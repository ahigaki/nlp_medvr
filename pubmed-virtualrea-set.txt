TI  - High-resolution 3D reconstructions of human vasculatures: creation of educational 
      tools and benchtop models for transcatheter devices.
PG  - 519-525

AB  - Transcatheter therapies are a common way to treat cardiovascular diseases. These 
      therapies are complicated by significant anatomical patient-to-patient variations 
      that exist in terms of transcatheter vascular pathways. Adding to the complexity 
      of transcatheter procedures, the training tools used for physician education 
      often overlook vast patient-to-patient variations and utilize idealized models of 
      patient anatomy that may be unrealistic. In this study, anatomically accurate 
      models were created from high-resolution images of real patient vasculatures. 
      Using fourteen human cadavers donated for research, we collected high-resolution 
      images to generate 3D computational renderings of various patient anatomies. 
      These models make up the "Transcatheter Pathways Vasculature Database" that can 
      be used for physician education and training, as well as improving transcatheter 
      delivery system design. We performed multiple studies that emphasize the 
      anatomical differences that exist in patient vasculatures. Using 3D printing and 
      virtual reality, we developed educational materials and benchtop models to train 
      physicians using true patient anatomies. These tools can also provide device 
      designers with data to improve their products based on real patient vessels. The 
      "Transcatheter Pathways Vasculature Database" highlights differences between 
      patient vasculatures. By educating and training physicians with patient anatomies 
      that accurately represent significant patient-to-patient variations, learning is 
      more translatable to what is seen in the clinic.

TI  - MeVisLab-OpenVR prototyping platform for virtual reality medical applications.
LID - 10.1007/s11548-022-02678-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Virtual reality (VR) can provide an added value for diagnosis and/or 
      intervention planning. Several VR software implementations have been proposed but 
      they are often application dependent. Previous attempts for a more generic 
      solution incorporating VR in medical prototyping software (MeVisLab) were still 
      lacking functionality precluding easy and flexible development. METHODS: We 
      propose an alternative solution that uses rendering to a graphical processing 
      unit (GPU) texture to enable rendering arbitrary Open Inventor scenes in a VR 
      context. It facilitates flexible development of user interaction and rendering of 
      more complex scenes involving multiple objects. We tested the platform in 
      planning a transcatheter cardiac stent placement procedure. RESULTS: This 
      approach proved to enable development of a particular implementation that 
      facilitates planning of percutaneous treatment of a sinus venosus atrial septal 
      defect. The implementation showed it is intuitive to plan and verify the 
      procedure using VR. CONCLUSION: An alternative implementation for linking OpenVR 
      with MeVisLab is provided that offers more flexible development of VR prototypes 
      which can facilitate further clinical validation of this technology in various 
      medical disciplines.

TI  - [A Novel Virtual-reality Imaging System in Cardiovascular Surgery:a Potentially 
      Promising Technology for Surgeons].
PG  - 403-410
AB  - Adequate preoperative planning may facilitate successful procedures in 
      cardiovascular surgery. We have developed a system named the Vesalius 3D suite, 
      combining three-dimensional (3D) image-processing software with an optic-tracking 
      spatial navigation, allowing quick, accessible 3D image interpretation for 
      virtual reality (VR) exploration and measurement from one or more of a range of 
      imaging modalities. We present a novel method of virtual imaging analysis for 
      preoperative planning and simulation in cardiovascular surgery using this 3D-VR 
      system. Based on unimodal or multimodal medical imaging data, digital imaging and 
      communication in medicine (DICOM) data sets can be reconstructed for 3D 
      visualization. Virtually reconstructed images can be viewed on flat-screen or 
      stereoscopic display, revealing each patient's specific anatomy and the internal 
      structures in exquisite detail. Highly accessible 3D interpretation promptly 
      permits precise measurements of repair-relevant anatomical parameters including 
      geometrically complex shapes. This technology may promote understanding of form 
      and function in the cardiovascular system, and facilitate operative procedures in 
      more challenging cases, and it seems especially valuable for any surgeon to gain 
      experience in practicing for rarely-performed procedures or uncommon 
      patient-specific preoperative surgical rehearsal.

TI  - Virtual reality-guided aortic valve leaflet reconstruction for type 0 bicuspid 
      aortic stenosis.
PG  - 1152-1154
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivab353 [doi]
AB  - Although virtual reality (VR) techniques that enable visualizing a patient's 
      anatomy stereoscopically have been developed recently, these techniques are still 
      scarcely used in clinical settings, and their benefits remain uncertain. Herein, 
      we demonstrate how VR preoperative planning facilitated the efficiency of a 
      complex surgical procedure. A 53-year-old male was diagnosed as type 0 bicuspid 
      aortic stenosis. To take haemodynamical advantage and to lower valve-related 
      reoperation risks, an aortic valve reconstruction was scheduled; however, 
      anatomical tri-leaflet neocuspidalization for type 0 bicuspid aortic root is 
      particularly challenging. To optimize the procedure, VR preoperative planning was 
      applied to create a blueprint of the aortic root rearrangement and suture line 
      design. This allowed for a competent aortic valve to be reconstructed speedily, 
      resulting in an excellent postoperative course.

AB  - We report a highly rare case of a large left ventricular myxoma with left 
      ventricular outflow tract obstruction in a previously healthy, asymptomatic 
      7-year-old male patient. For preoperative planning, we used end-diastolic 
      computed tomography data to model the patient's cardiovascular structures and 
      then generated a virtual reality model and a 3-dimensional-printed model. They 
      helped the surgeon completely manage the details of the surgery. The mass was 
      completely resected in one piece uneventfully. Histopathologic examination 
      confirmed the diagnosis of myxoma. We believe that 3-dimensional technologies may 
      be effective if the traditional modalities were insufficient in those rare, 
      complex, and heterogeneous cases.

TI  - Virtual Reality-Induced Dissociative Symptoms: A Retrospective Study.
LID - 10.1089/g4h.2022.0009 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The use of virtual reality (VR) has been increasing worldwide, as 
      devices are becoming more sophisticated and provide an escape from reality during 
      the COVID-19 lockdown. This recent rise in the use of VR leads to new side 
      effects being reported, such as dissociative symptoms that may or may not 
      constitute a mental health concern. This retrospective study investigated the 
      prevalence and intensity of dissociative symptoms in VR users, as well as some 
      potential predisposing conditions that may trigger them, and their impact on the 
      subjects' wellbeing. Materials and Methods: We conducted a survey (n = 358) that 
      was posted on VR Facebook groups. This survey was approved by the University of 
      Lisbon Medical Faculty's IRB, and comprised a modified version of the 
      Clinician-Administered Dissociative State Scale (CADSS) and questions regarding 
      potential risk factors known to induce dissociative disorders or experiences. 
      Results: Data analysis revealed that 83.9% participants reported dissociative 
      symptoms, with varying intensity according to CADSS (X̄ = 7.62; s = 7.89). 
      Significant correlations were found between CADSS score and the time spent 
      playing, the use of software applications (apps) that involve virtual hands or 
      hand tracking, history of previous dissociative experiences, traumatic childhood 
      events, avoidant coping strategies, and psychiatric disorders. Nonetheless, most 
      participants categorized the symptoms as nonanxiogenic (85.8%) and minute lasting 
      (77.4%). Conclusion: In conclusion, this study revealed that although VR can 
      induce dissociative experiences, they seem to be short lasting and nonthreatening

TI  - HEARTBEAT4D: An Open-source Toolbox for Turning 4D Cardiac CT into VR/AR.
LID - 10.1007/s10278-022-00659-y [doi]
AB  - Four-dimensional data sets are increasingly common in MRI and CT. While clinical 
      visualization often focuses on individual temporal phases capturing the tissue(s) 
      of interest, it may be possible to gain additional insight through exploring 
      animated 3D reconstructions of physiological motion made possible by augmented or 
      virtual reality representations of 4D patient imaging. Cardiac CT acquisitions 
      can provide sufficient spatial resolution and temporal data to support advanced 
      visualization, however, there are no open-source tools readily available to 
      facilitate the transformation from raw medical images to dynamic and interactive 
      augmented or virtual reality representations. To address this gap, we developed a 
      workflow using free and open-source tools to process 4D cardiac CT imaging 
      starting from raw DICOM data and ending with dynamic AR representations viewable 
      on a phone, tablet, or computer. In addition to assembling the workflow using 
      existing platforms (3D Slicer and Unity), we also contribute two new features: 1. 
      custom software which can propagate a segmentation created for one cardiac phase 
      to all others and export to surface files in a fully automated fashion, and 2. a 
      user interface and linked code for the animation and interactive review of the 
      surfaces in augmented reality. Validation of the surface-based areas demonstrated 
      excellent correlation with radiologists' image-based areas (R > 0.99). While our 
      tools were developed specifically for 4D cardiac CT, the open framework will 
      allow it to serve as a blueprint for similar applications applied to 4D imaging 
      of other tissues and using other modalities. We anticipate this and related 
      workflows will be useful both clinically and for educational purposes.

LID - 10.1111/jocs.16569 [doi]
AB  - Improvementsin medical imaging and a steady increase in computing power are 
      leading to new possibilities in the field of cardiovascular interventions. 
      Interventions can be planned in advance in greater detail, even to the point of 
      simulating procedures. Nevertheless, all techniques are at an early stage of 
      development. It is of utmost importance that tools, especially if they can be 
      used as decision support are intensively validated and their accuracy is 
      demonstrated. In our commentary, we summarize current techniques for 
      impprovements in planning and guiding of procedures, but also critically discuss 
      the downsides of these techniques. Following the work of Kenichi and colleagues, 
      we also discuss necessary steps in advancing new tools and techniques, 
      particularly as they are used in routine clinical practice. We also discuss the 
      role of artificial intelligence, which could play a crucial role in this context 
      in the future.

LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehac266 [doi]
AB  - Congenital heart disease (CHD) is often comprised of complex three-dimensional 
      (3D) anatomy that must be well understood to assess the pathophysiological 
      consequences and guide therapy. Thus, detailed cardiac imaging for early 
      detection and planning of interventional and/or surgical treatment is paramount. 
      Advanced technologies have revolutionized diagnostic and therapeutic practice in 
      CHD, thus playing an increasing role in its management. Traditional reliance on 
      standard imaging modalities including echocardiography, cardiac computed 
      tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been augmented by the 
      use of recent technologies such as 3D printing, virtual reality, augmented 
      reality, computational modelling, and artificial intelligence because of 
      insufficient information available with these standard imaging techniques. This 
      has created potential opportunities of incorporating these technologies into 
      routine clinical practice to achieve the best outcomes through delivery of 
      personalized medicine. In this review, we provide an overview of these evolving 
      technologies and a new approach enabling physicians to better understand their 
      real-world application in adult CHD as a prelude to clinical workflow 
      implementation.

AB  - The recent pandemic launched an acceleration in adopting telemedicine by 
      cardiovascular health and triggered the flourishing of technological 
      advancements, such as the metaverse, which is a novel interactive mix of digital 
      worlds that leverages augmented reality with virtual reality. The CardioVerse 
      represents a theoretical term for the embracement of the metaverse by 
      cardiovascular medicine, encompassing the endless possibilities as well as the 
      challenges that it holds and introduces new dimensions to disease education, 
      prevention and diagnosis. Its applications are numerous, notably in enhancing 
      medical visits, assisting cardiovascular interventions and reshaping the way 
      medical education is provided. Although obstacles are expected in diverse domains 
      such as security, technical, legislative and regulatory, the utilization of 
      non-fungible tokens as a security asset for patient data appears as potential 
      solution.

TI  - Long-term Effect of Face-to-Face vs Virtual Reality Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 
      (CPR) Training on Willingness to Perform CPR, Retention of Knowledge, and 
      Dissemination of CPR Awareness: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical 
      Trial.
PG  - e2212964

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Increased bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is essential 
      to improve survival after cardiac arrest. Although most studies focus on 
      technical CPR skills, the randomized Lowlands Saves Lives trial prespecified a 
      follow-up survey on other important aspects that affect the widespread 
      performance of CPR. OBJECTIVE: To investigate bystander willingness to perform 
      CPR on a stranger, theoretical knowledge retention, and dissemination of CPR 
      awareness 6 months after undergoing short face-to-face and virtual reality (VR) 
      CPR trainings. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prespecified 6-month 
      posttraining survey was conducted among 320 participants in the Lowlands Saves 
      Lives trial, a randomized comparison between 20-minute face-to-face, 
      instructor-led CPR training and VR training. Participants were recruited at the 
      Lowlands music festival, with a designated area to conduct scientific projects 
      (August 16-18, 2019; the Netherlands). Statistical analysis was performed from 
      March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Two standardized 20-minute 
      protocols on CPR and automated external defibrillator use: instructor-led 
      face-to-face training using CPR manikins or VR training using the Resuscitation 
      Council (UK)-endorsed Lifesaver VR smartphone application and a pillow to 
      practice compressions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were 
      willingness to perform CPR on a stranger, theoretical knowledge retention, and 
      dissemination of CPR awareness as reported by the entire cohort. As secondary 
      analyses, the results of the 2 training modalities were compared. RESULTS: Of 381 
      participants, 320 consented to this follow-up survey; 188 participants (115 women 
      [61%]; median age, 26 years [IQR, 22-32 years]) completed the entire survey and 
      were accordingly included in the secondary analysis. The overall proportion of 
      participants willing to perform CPR on a stranger was 77% (144 of 188): 81% (79 
      of 97) among face-to-face participants and 71% (65 of 91) among VR participants 
      (P = .02); 103 participants (55%) reported feeling scared to perform CPR 
      (P = .91). Regarding theoretical knowledge retention, a median of 7 (IQR, 6-8) of 
      9 questions were answered correctly in both groups (P = .81). Regarding 
      dissemination of CPR awareness, 65% of participants (123 of 188) told at least 1 
      to 10 family members or friends about the importance of CPR, and 15% (29 of 188) 
      had participated in certified, instructor-led training at the time of the survey, 
      without differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this 6-month 
      posttraining survey, young adult participants of short CPR training modules 
      reported high willingness (77%) to perform CPR on a stranger, with slightly 
      higher rates for face-to-face than for VR participants. Theoretical knowledge 
      retention was good, and the high dissemination of awareness suggests that these 
      novel CPR training modules staged at a public event are promising sensitizers for 
      involvement in CPR, although further challenges include mitigating the fear of 
      performing CPR. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04013633.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the accuracy of two methods of 
      measuring features in cardiac anatomy, using an objective standard cast model. 
      METHODS: We made a silicone cast using a swine heart. Computerized tomography 
      data of the solidified cast were processed through virtual reality (VR) software 
      and through two-dimensional multiplanar-reconstruction (2D-MPR), and all 
      measurements were compared against physical measurements of the cast. RESULTS: 
      The cast perfectly demonstrated the fine detail of the aortic valve and the 
      proximal parts of coronary arteries. Anatomical features were measured by 3D-VR, 
      2D-MPR, and directly on the cast. Measurement differences between 2D-MPR and the 
      cast were on average at least 3.6 times larger than those between 3D-VR and the 
      cast. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the observed accuracy, 3D-VR measurements seem 
      considerably more accurate than the current standard 2D-MPR, and 3D-VR may be 
      considered as the next gold standard for 3D measurement of cardiac anatomy in 
      vivo.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early mobilization of patients in the postoperative period of 
      cardiac surgery who are hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a 
      practice that has a positive impact. METHODS: This is a systematic review of 
      studies published until September 2020 in the Medical Literature Analysis and 
      Retrieval System Online (or MEDLINE®), Embase, Physiotherapy Evidence Database 
      (or PEDro), Scientific Electronic Library Online (or SciELO), and Latin American 
      and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (or LILACS) databases. Randomized 
      clinical trials describing mobilization protocols performed early in ICU patients 
      after cardiac surgery were included. RESULTS: According to the eligibility 
      criteria, only 14 of the 1,128 articles found were included in the analysis. 
      Early mobilization protocols were initiated in the immediate postoperative period 
      or first postoperative day. The resources and technics used were progressive 
      mobilization, cycle ergometer, early bed activities, walking protocols, 
      resistance exercise, and virtual reality. Intensity of the mobilization 
      activities was determined using the Borg scale and heart rate. CONCLUSION: Early 
      mobilization protocols are generalist (not individual), and low-intensity 
      exercises are used, through progressive mobilization, with two daily physical 
      therapy sessions, during 10 to 30 minutes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality-based therapy (VRBT) has been recently used in 
      rehabilitation programs, as it can improve patient's adherence to treatment. 
      However, patients' acceptance of VRBT has been scarcely investigated. OBJECTIVE: 
      To qualitatively analyze the perceptions and preferences of patients about the 
      inclusion of VRBT to a conventional cardiovascular rehabilitation program (CRP). 
      METHODS: Fifteen patients from a randomized clinical trial participated in focus 
      groups for qualitative assessment. RESULTS: Patients demonstrated good acceptance 
      and satisfaction of VRBT. Physical and psychosocial benefits were highlighted, 
      and patients reported the perception of higher exercise intensity in VRBT then 
      when doing conventional training. In addition, the frequency of VRBT (once a 
      week), associated with conventional treatment was reported as satisfactory. 
      Cognitive aspects that influenced participation to the new approach were also 
      raised by study participants. CONCLUSION: Patients with cardiac conditions 
      demonstrated satisfaction with the inclusion of VRBT in a conventional CRP, 
      demonstrating that VRBT has the potential to be a new approach for this patient 
      population, allowing training diversification. Benefits perceived by patients 
      include physical, mental, and social aspects. TRIAL REGISTERED: NCT04336306

TI  - A Novel 3D Visualized Operative Procedure in the Single-Stage Complete Repair 
      With Unifocalization of Pulmonary Atresia With Ventricular Septal Defect and 
      Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries.
PG  - 836200
LID - 10.3389/fcvm.2022.836200 [doi]
LID - 836200
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and major 
      aortopulmonary collateral arteries (PA/VSD/MAPCAs) is a relatively rare, complex, 
      and heterogeneous congenital heart disease. As one of the effective treatments, 
      the midline unifocalization strategy still remains complicated and challenging 
      due to the diverse forms of MAPCAs and pulmonary arteries. The purpose of this 
      study is to summarize our experience of a novel three-dimensional (3D) visualized 
      operative procedure in the single-stage complete repair with unifocalization and 
      to clarify the benefits it may bring to us. METHODS: We described our experience 
      of the 3D visualized operative procedure such as 3D printing, virtual reality 
      (VR), and mixed reality (MR) technology in patients with PA/VSD/MAPCAs who 
      underwent a single-stage complete repair with unifocalization. The data from the 
      patients who underwent this procedure (3D group) and those who underwent the 
      conventional procedure (conventional group) were compared. RESULTS: The 
      conventional and 3D groups included 11 patients from September 2011 to December 
      2017 and 9 from January 2018 to March 2021, respectively. The baseline 
      characteristics such as age, body weight, preoperative saturation, the anatomy of 
      the pulmonary arteries and MAPCAs, the Nakata index, and TNPAI had no statistical 
      significance. All 9 patients in the 3D group were operated only through a median 
      sternotomy, while 8 cases (72.7%) in the conventional group needed another 
      posterolateral thoracotomy (p = 0.001). In the 3D group, the CPB time was shorter 
      (93.2 ± 63.8 vs. 145.1 ± 68.4 min, p = 0.099), and the median pre-CPB time per 
      MAPCAs was significantly shorter [25.7 (14.0, 46.3) vs. 65 (41.3, 75.0) min, p = 
      0.031]. There was no early death in the 3D group, while there were 3 in the 
      conventional group (0 vs. 27.3%, p = 0.218). CONCLUSION: The novel 3D visualized 
      operative procedure may help improve the performance of the single-stage complete 
      repair with the midline unifocalization of PA/VSD/MAPCAs and help shorten the 
      dissecting time of the MAPCAs. It may promote the routine and successful 
      application of this strategy in more centers.

TI  - Evaluation Challenges for the Application of Extended Reality Devices in 
      Medicine.
LID - 10.1007/s10278-022-00622-x [doi]
AB  - Augmented and virtual reality devices are being actively investigated and 
      implemented for a wide range of medical uses. However, significant gaps in the 
      evaluation of these medical devices and applications hinder their regulatory 
      evaluation. Addressing these gaps is critical to demonstrating the devices' 
      safety and effectiveness. We outline the key technical and clinical evaluation 
      challenges discussed during the US Food and Drug Administration's public 
      workshop, "Medical Extended Reality: Toward Best Evaluation Practices for Virtual 
      and Augmented Reality in Medicine" and future directions for evaluation method 
      development. Evaluation challenges were categorized into several key technical 
      and clinical areas. Finally, we highlight current efforts in the standards 
      communities and illustrate connections between the evaluation challenges and the 
      intended uses of the medical extended reality (MXR) devices. Participants 
      concluded that additional research is needed to assess the safety and 
      effectiveness of MXR devices across the use cases.

LID - 10.1017/S1047951122000890 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Virtual reality has emerged as a unique educational modality for 
      medical trainees. However, incorporation of virtual reality curricula into formal 
      training programmes has been limited. We describe a multi-centre effort to 
      develop, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of a virtual reality curriculum for 
      residents participating in paediatric cardiology rotations. METHODS: A virtual 
      reality software program ("The Stanford Virtual Heart") was utilised. Users are 
      placed "inside the heart" and explore non-traditional views of cardiac anatomy. 
      Modules for six common congenital heart lesions were developed, including 
      narrative scripts. A prospective case-control study was performed involving three 
      large paediatric residency programmes. From July 2018 to June 2019, trainees 
      participating in an outpatient cardiology rotation completed a 27-question, 
      validated assessment tool. From July 2019 to February 2020, trainees completed 
      the virtual reality curriculum and assessment tool during their cardiology 
      rotation. Qualitative feedback on the virtual reality experience was also 
      gathered. Intervention and control group performances were compared using 
      univariate analyses. RESULTS: There were 80 trainees in the control group and 52 
      in the intervention group. Trainees in the intervention group achieved higher 
      scores on the assessment (20.4 ± 2.9 versus 18.8 ± 3.8 out of 27 questions 
      answered correctly, p = 0.01). Further analysis showed significant improvement in 
      the intervention group for questions specifically testing visuospatial concepts. 
      In total, 100% of users recommended integration of the programme into the 
      residency curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality is an effective and 
      well-received adjunct to clinical curricula for residents participating in 
      paediatric cardiology rotations. Our results support continued virtual reality 
      use and expansion to include other trainees.

TI  - Clinical 3D modeling to guide pediatric cardiothoracic surgery and intervention 
      using 3D printed anatomic models, computer aided design and virtual reality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical and catheter-based interventions for congenital heart 
      disease require precise understanding of complex anatomy. The use of 
      three-dimensional (3D) printing and virtual reality to enhance visuospatial 
      understanding has been well documented, but integration of these methods into 
      routine clinical practice has not been well described. We review the growth and 
      development of a clinical 3D modeling service to inform procedural planning 
      within a high-volume pediatric heart center. METHODS: Clinical 3D modeling was 
      performed using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) or computed tomography (CT) 
      derived data. Image segmentation and post-processing was performed using 
      FDA-approved software. Patient-specific anatomy was visualized using 3D printed 
      models, digital flat screen models and virtual reality. Surgical repair options 
      were digitally designed using proprietary and open-source computer aided design 
      (CAD) based modeling tools. RESULTS: From 2018 to 2020 there were 112 individual 
      3D modeling cases performed, 16 for educational purposes and 96 clinically 
      utilized for procedural planning. Over the 3-year period, demand for clinical 
      modeling tripled and in 2020, 3D modeling was requested in more than one-quarter 
      of STAT category 3, 4 and 5 cases. The most common indications for modeling were 
      complex biventricular repair (n = 30, 31%) and repair of multiple ventricular 
      septal defects (VSD) (n = 11, 12%). CONCLUSIONS: Using a multidisciplinary 
      approach, clinical application of 3D modeling can be seamlessly integrated into 
      pre-procedural care for patients with congenital heart disease. Rapid expansion 
      and increased demand for utilization of these tools within a high-volume center 
      demonstrate the high value conferred on these techniques by surgeons and 
      interventionalists alike.

TI  - The Use of Virtual Therapy in Cardiac Rehabilitation of Male Patients with 
      Coronary Heart Disease: A Randomized Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10040745 [doi]
LID - 745
AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality therapy (VRT) in 
      the treatment of anxiety-depressive disorders and in reducing stress levels in a 
      group of men with coronary heart disease (CHD) participating in cardiac 
      rehabilitation (CR). The study included 34 men with CHD who were assigned to the 
      experimental group (EG) or the control group (CG). CR in the EG was supported by 
      8 VRT sessions, while CR in the CG was supplemented with 8 SAT sessions. 
      Anxiety-depressive disorders were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale (HADS). Perceived stress was assessed using the Perception of 
      Stress Questionnaire (PSQ). In the EG, all measured parameters improved after the 
      intervention. Significant reductions in HADS total score, the HADS-A, general 
      stress score, emotional tension, and the external stress were obtained. In the 
      CG, a deterioration in all measured parameters was observed. Significant changes 
      were obtained in the general stress score and intrapsychic stress. The analysis 
      between groups showed that the effectiveness of psychological interventions 
      significantly differed between groups. The study results confirmed that 
      supplementing standard CR with VRT leads to an improvement in the mental state of 
      the patients and thus has a positive effect on the course of CR. However, the 
      small sample size and high withdrawal rate prompt cautious interpretation of the 
      results.

TI  - A multimedia paediatric cardiology assessment tool for medical students and 
      general paediatric trainees: development and validation.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1017/S1047951122001123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding how cardiovascular structure and physiology guide 
      management is critically important in paediatric cardiology. However, few 
      validated educational tools are available to assess trainee knowledge. To address 
      this deficit, paediatric cardiologists and fellows from four institutions 
      collaborated to develop a multimedia assessment tool for use with medical 
      students and paediatric residents. This tool was developed in support of a novel 
      3-dimensional virtual reality curriculum created by our group. METHODS: 
      Educational domains were identified, and questions were iteratively developed by 
      a group of clinicians from multiple centres to assess understanding of key 
      concepts. To evaluate content validity, content experts completed the assessment 
      and reviewed items, rating item relevance to educational domains using a 4-point 
      Likert scale. An item-level content validity index was calculated for each 
      question, and a scale-level content validity index was calculated for the 
      assessment tool, with scores of ≥0.78 and ≥0.90, respectively, representing 
      excellent content validity. RESULTS: The mean content expert assessment score was 
      92% (range 88-97%). Two questions yielded ≤50% correct content expert answers. 
      The item-level content validity index for 29 out of 32 questions was ≥0.78, and 
      the scale-level content validity index was 0.92. Qualitative feedback included 
      suggestions for future improvement. Questions with ≤50% content expert agreement 
      and item-level content validity index scores <0.78 were removed, yielding a 
      27-question assessment tool. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a multi-centre effort to 
      create and validate a multimedia assessment tool which may be implemented within 
      paediatric trainee cardiology curricula. Future efforts may focus on content 
      refinement and expansion to include additional educational domains.

TI  - Efficacy of mirror therapy and virtual reality therapy in alleviating phantom 
      limb pain: a meta-analysis and systematic review.
PG  - 173-177
LID - 10.1136/bmjmilitary-2021-002018 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Amputations result from trauma, war, conflict, vascular diseases 
      and cancer. Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a potentially debilitating form of chronic 
      pain affecting around 100 million amputees across the world. Mirror therapy and 
      virtual reality (VR) are two commonly used treatments, and we evaluated their 
      respective success rates. METHODS: A meta-analysis and systematic review was 
      undertaken to investigate mirror therapy and VR in their ability to reduce pain 
      levels. A mean difference (MD) model to compare group pain levels pretreatment 
      and post-treatment via aggregating these results from numerous similar studies 
      was employed. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan (V.5.4) and expressed in 
      MD for visual analogue scale (VAS) score. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies met our 
      search criteria; they consisted of eight mirror therapy with 214 participants and 
      seven VR including 86 participants, totalling 300 participants. Mean age ranged 
      from 36 to 63 years, 77% male, of which 61% were lower body amputees. Both led to 
      a VAS reduction (mirror therapy mean reduction VAS score was 2.54, 95% CI 1.42 to 
      3.66; p<0.001; VR 2.24, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.20; p<0.001). There was no statistically 
      significant difference in pain alleviation between mirror therapy and VR 
      (p=0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Mirror therapy and VR are both equally efficacious in 
      alleviating PLP, but neither is more effective than the other. However, due to 
      small sample size and limited number of studies, factors such as gender, cause of 
      amputation, site of limb loss or length of time from amputation, which may 
      influence treatment success, could not be explored.

TI  - Virtual Reality Based Active Shooter Training Drill Increases Salivary and 
      Subjective Markers of Stress.
PG  - 105-113
AB  - Law enforcement personnel are required to respond to a variety of dangerous, 
      potentially life-threatening high stress scenarios. Virtual reality (VR)-based 
      training has been shown to attenuate stress responses; however, little is known 
      about the acute stress response from VR exposure. This study examined the impact 
      of participating in a VR-based active shooter training drill (ASD) on markers of 
      physiological stress as well as potential differences in men and women. To 
      examine the impact of participation in a ~50 sec VR-based ASD, 29 subjects (n = 
      29; 17 males, 12 females) participated in a quasi-experimental single group 
      design. Saliva samples were collected and analyzed from 27 of the 29 subjects a 
      total of four times 1) 30-min prior to, 2) 5-min prior to, 3) 5-min after, and 4) 
      30-min after the ASD and analyzed for α-amylase (AA) activity and concentrations 
      of secretory immunoglobulin-A (SIgA), cortisol (CORT), and uric acid (UA). 
      Participation in the ASD resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in 
      salivary stress markers AA and SIgA. In addition, lower concentrations of CORT 
      and UA were found in women compared to men. These findings have implications for 
      law enforcement and/or military personnel that may seek to implement a VR-based 
      training into their training regimen. Future studies should investigate the 
      impact of longitudinal participation in ASD interventions to determine if this is 
      an effective training method to reduce stress responses to real life active 
      shooter training drills.

TI  - The Disruption of Trust in the Digital Transformation Leading to Health 4.0.
PG  - 815573

LID - 815573
AB  - The specification and application of policies and guidelines for public health, 
      medical education and training, and screening programmes for preventative 
      medicine are all predicated on trust relationships between medical authorities, 
      health practitioners and patients. These relationships are in turn predicated on 
      a verbal contract that is over two thousand years old. The impact of information 
      and communication technology (ICT), underpinning Health 4.0, has the potential to 
      disrupt this analog relationship in several dimensions; but it also presents an 
      opportunity to strengthen it, and so to increase the take-up and effectiveness of 
      new policies. This paper develops an analytic framework for the trust 
      relationships in Health 4.0, and through three use cases, assesses a medical 
      policy, the introduction of a new technology, and the implications of that 
      technology for the trust relationships. We integrate this assessment in a set of 
      actionable recommendations, in particular that the trust framework should be part 
      of the design methodology for developing and deploying medical applications. In a 
      concluding discussion, we advocate that, in a post-pandemic world, IT to support 
      policies and programmes to address widespread socio-medical problems with mental 
      health, long Covid, physical inactivity and vaccine misinformation will be 
      essential, and for that, strong trust relationships between all the stakeholders 
      are absolutely critical.

AB  - Three-dimensional printing (3DP) has recently gained importance in the medical 
      industry, especially in surgical specialties. It uses different techniques and 
      materials based on patients' needs, which allows bioprofessionals to design and 
      develop unique pieces using medical imaging provided by computed tomography (CT) 
      and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therefore, the Department of Biology and 
      Medicine and the Department of Physics and Engineering, at the Bioastronautics 
      and Space Mechatronics Research Group, have managed and supervised an 
      international cooperation study, in order to present a general review of the 
      innovative surgical applications, focused on anatomical systems, such as the 
      nervous and craniofacial system, cardiovascular system, digestive system, 
      genitourinary system, and musculoskeletal system. Finally, the integration with 
      augmented, mixed, virtual reality is analyzed to show the advantages of 
      personalized treatments, taking into account the improvements for preoperative, 
      intraoperative planning, and medical training. Also, this article explores the 
      creation of devices and tools for space surgery to get better outcomes under 
      changing gravity conditions.

TI  - Successful staged separation of total angular craniopagus.
LID - 10.23736/S0390-5616.21.05633-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Total craniopagus is an exceedingly rare condition in which surgical 
      treatment is complex and potentially fatal. Over the last decades, a multistep 
      surgical approach, which allows development of venous collateral circulation, has 
      fostered a dramatic improvement of successful separation rates and neurological 
      outcomes. Most of the experience derives from management of vertical craniopagus, 
      the angular form being rarer and less amenable to successful surgical separation. 
      METHODS: We present a case of total angular craniopagus twins observed at our 
      Institution. Specific features included a large occipital fusion area with a bone 
      defect, complete separation of brain and arterial vessels and a complex 
      configuration of dural venous sinuses. The superior sagittal sinus of each twin 
      preferentially drained to a single transverse sinus through a shared torcular. 
      RESULTS: After an extensive diagnostic phase, including neuroimaging, 
      tridimensional and virtual reality modelling, neurological, neurophysiological 
      and rehabilitation assessment, a detailed multistep surgical plan, was proposed 
      to a wide multidisciplinary team. The venous system was managed by taking 
      advantage of the fact each twin's superior sagittal sinus was drained 
      preferentially by the transverse sinus on the twin's left. The transverse sinuses 
      were thus separated accordingly. CONCLUSIONS: Successful separation was achieved 
      in three surgical steps over one year, with an excellent outcome for both twins.

TI  - Effects of Exergaming in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Compared to 
      Conventional Cardiac Rehabilitation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19063492 [doi]
LID - 3492
AB  - Background: Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs are used for 
      improving prognosis and quality of life in patients with cardiovascular disease 
      (CVD). Nonetheless, adherence to these programs is low, and exercise-based CR 
      programs based on virtual reality (i.e., exergaming) have been proposed as an 
      alternative to conventional CR programs. However, whether exergaming programs are 
      superior to conventional CR programs in patients with CVD is not known. 
      Objective: This systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted to explore 
      whether exergaming enhances exercise capacity, quality of life, mental health, 
      motivation, and exercise adherence to a greater extent than conventional CR 
      programs in patients with CVD. Method: Electronic searches were carried out in 
      PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
      Literature databases up to June 2021. Meta-analyses were performed using robust 
      variance estimation with small-sample corrections. The effect sizes were 
      calculated as the mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) as 
      appropriate. The SMD magnitude was classified as trivial (&lt;0.20), small 
      (0.20-0.49), medium (0.50-0.79), or large (≥0.80). Heterogeneity was interpreted 
      based on the I(2) statistics as low (25%), moderate (50%), or high (75%). 
      Results: Pooled analyses showed no differences between exergaming and 
      conventional CR programs for enhancing exercise capacity (i.e., distance covered 
      in the six-minute walk test) (MD(+) = 14.07 m (95% confidence interval (CI) 
      -38.18 to 66.32 m); p = 0.426) and mental health (SMD(+) = 0.17 (95% CI -0.36 to 
      0.70); p = 0.358). The results showed a small, statistically nonsignificant 
      improvement in quality of life in favor of exergaming (SMD(+) = 0.22 (95% CI = 
      -0.37 to 0.81); p = 0.294). Moderate heterogeneity was found for exercise 
      capacity (I(2) = 53.7%), while no heterogeneity was found for quality of life 
      (I(2) = 3.3%) and mental health (I(2) = 0.0%). Conclusions: Exergaming seems not 
      to be superior to conventional CR programs for improving exercise capacity, 
      quality of life, or mental health in patients with CVD.

TI  - Virtual reality cognitive intervention for heart failure: CORE study protocol.
PG  - e12230
LID - 10.1002/trc2.12230 [doi]
LID - e12230
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent, serious chronic illness that 
      affects 6.5 million adults in the United States. Among patients with HF, the 
      prevalence of attention impairment is reported to range from 15% to 27%. Although 
      attention is fundamental to human activities including HF self-care, cognitive 
      interventions for patients with HF that target improvement in attention are 
      scarce. The COgnitive intervention to Restore attention using nature Environment 
      (CORE) study aims to test the preliminary efficacy of the newly developed 
      Nature-VR, a virtual reality-based cognitive intervention that is based on the 
      restorative effects of nature. Nature-VR development was guided by Attention 
      Restoration Theory. The target outcomes are attention, HF self-care, and 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Our exploratory aims examine the 
      associations between attention and several putative/established HF biomarkers 
      (eg, oxygen saturation, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, apolipoprotein E, 
      dopamine receptor, and dopamine transporter genes) as well as the effect of 
      Nature-VR on cognitive performance in other domains (ie, global cognition, 
      memory, visuospatial, executive function, and language), cardiac and neurological 
      events, and mortality. METHODS: This single-blinded, two-group 
      randomized-controlled pilot study will enroll 74 participants with HF. The 
      Nature-VR intervention group will view three-dimensional nature pictures using a 
      virtual reality headset for 10 minutes per day, 5 days per week for 4 weeks (a 
      total of 200 minutes). The active comparison group, Urban-VR, will view 
      three-dimensional urban pictures using a virtual reality headset to match the 
      Nature-VR intervention in intervention dose and delivery mode, but not in 
      content. After baseline interviews, four follow-up interviews will be conducted 
      to assess sustained effects of Nature-VR at 4, 8, 26, and 52 weeks. DISCUSSION: 
      The importance and novelty of this study consists of using a first-of-its kind, 
      immersive virtual reality technology to target attention and in investigating the 
      health outcomes of the Nature-VR cognitive intervention among patients with HF.

AB  - Virtual and augmented reality can be defined as a three-dimensional real-world 
      simulation allowing the user to directly interact with it. Throughout the years, 
      virtual reality has gained great popularity in medicine and is currently being 
      adopted for a wide range of purposes. Due to its dynamic anatomical nature, 
      permanent drive towards decreasing invasiveness, and strive for innovation, 
      cardiac surgery depicts itself as a unique environment for virtual reality. 
      Despite substantial research limitations in cardiac surgery, the current 
      literature has shown great applicability of this technology, and promising 
      opportunities.

TI  - Virtual Reality Simulation Training for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation After 
      Cardiac Surgery: Face and Content Validity Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest after cardiac surgery commonly has a reversible cause, 
      where emergency resternotomy is often required for treatment, as recommended by 
      international guidelines. We have developed a virtual reality (VR) simulation for 
      training of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency resternotomy 
      procedures after cardiac surgery, the Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Virtual 
      Reality Simulator (CPVR-sim). Two fictive clinical scenarios were used: one case 
      of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and a combined case of PEA and ventricular 
      fibrillation. In this prospective study, we researched the face validity and 
      content validity of the CPVR-sim. OBJECTIVE: We designed a prospective study to 
      assess the feasibility and to establish the face and content validity of two 
      clinical scenarios (shockable and nonshockable cardiac arrest) of the CPVR-sim 
      partly divided into a group of novices and experts in performing CPR and 
      emergency resternotomies in patients after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Clinicians 
      (staff cardiothoracic surgeons, physicians, surgical residents, nurse 
      practitioners, and medical students) participated in this study and performed two 
      different scenarios, either PEA or combined PEA and ventricular fibrillation. All 
      participants (N=41) performed a simulation and completed the questionnaire rating 
      the simulator's usefulness, satisfaction, ease of use, effectiveness, and 
      immersiveness to assess face validity and content validity. RESULTS: Responses 
      toward face validity and content validity were predominantly positive in both 
      groups. Most participants in the PEA scenario (n=26, 87%) felt actively involved 
      in the simulation, and 23 (77%) participants felt in charge of the situation. The 
      participants thought it was easy to learn how to interact with the software 
      (n=24, 80%) and thought that the software responded adequately (n=21, 70%). All 
      15 (100%) expert participants preferred VR training as an addition to 
      conventional training. Moreover, 13 (87%) of the expert participants would 
      recommend VR training to other colleagues, and 14 (93%) of the expert 
      participants thought the CPVR-sim was a useful method to train for infrequent 
      post-cardiac surgery emergencies requiring CPR. Additionally, 10 (91%) of the 
      participants thought it was easy to move in the VR environment, and that the 
      CPVR-sim responded adequately in this scenario. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a 
      proof-of-concept VR simulation for CPR training with two scenarios of a patient 
      after cardiac surgery, which participants found was immersive and useful. By 
      proving the face validity and content validity of the CPVR-sim, we present the 
      first step toward a cardiothoracic surgery VR training platform.

AB  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly gaining popularity in 
      every aspect of cardiovascular medicine. This review discusses the past, present, 
      and future of artificial intelligence in education, remote proctoring, 
      credentialing, research, and publication as they pertain to cardiovascular 
      procedures. This review describes the benefits and limitations of artificial 
      intelligence and machine learning and the exciting potential of integrating 
      advanced simulation, holography, virtual reality, and extended reality into 
      disease diagnosis and patient care, as well as their roles in cardiovascular 
      research and education. Nonetheless, much of the available data resides in 
      electronic medical records or within industry-sponsored proprietary programs that 
      are not compatible or standardized for current clinical application. Many areas 
      in cardiovascular medicine would benefit from the introduction or increased use 
      of artificial intelligence. Web-based artificial intelligence applications could 
      be used to address unmet needs for education, on-demand procedural proctoring, 
      credentialing, and recredentialing for interventionists and physicians in remote 
      locations. Further progress in artificial intelligence will require further 
      collaboration among computer scientists and researchers in order to identify and 
      correct the most relevant problems and to implement the best data-based approach 
      to achieving this goal. The future success of artificial intelligence in 
      cardiovascular medicine will depend on the degree of collaboration between all 
      pertinent experts in this field. This will undoubtedly be a prolonged, stepwise 
      process.

LID - e217576
AB  - Cardiac electrophysiology requires the processing of several patient-specific 
      data points in real time to provide an accurate diagnosis and determine an 
      optimal therapy. Expanding beyond the traditional tools that have been used to 
      extract information from patient-specific data, machine learning offers a new set 
      of advanced tools capable of revealing previously unknown data patterns and 
      features. This new tool set can substantially improve the speed and level of 
      confidence with which electrophysiologists can determine patient-specific 
      diagnoses and therapies. The ability to process substantial amounts of data in 
      real time also paves the way to novel techniques for data collection and 
      visualization. Extended realities such as virtual and augmented reality can now 
      enable the real-time visualization of 3-dimensional images in space. This enables 
      improved preprocedural planning and intraprocedural interventions. Machine 
      learning supplemented with novel visualization technologies could substantially 
      improve patient care and outcomes by helping physicians to make more informed 
      patient-specific decisions. This article presents current applications of machine 
      learning and their use in cardiac electrophysiology.

TI  - Mobile-Health based physical activities co-production policies towards 
      cardiovascular diseases prevention: findings from a mixed-method systematic 
      review.
PG  - 277
LID - 10.1186/s12913-022-07637-8 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the first cause of death globally, 
      with huge costs worldwide. Most cases of CVD could be prevented by addressing 
      behavioural risk factors. Among these factors, there is physical and amateur 
      sports activity (PASA), which has a linear negative correlation with the risk of 
      CVD. Nevertheless, attempts to encourage PASA, as exercise prescription 
      programmes, achieved little impact at the community-wide level. A new frontier to 
      promote PASA is represented by mobile health tools, such as exergaming, mobile 
      device apps, health wearables, GPS/GIS and virtual reality. Nevertheless, there 
      has not yet been any evident turnabout in patient active involvement towards CVD 
      prevention, and inactivity rates are even increasing. This study aims at framing 
      the state of the art of the literature about the use of m-health in supporting 
      PASA, as a user-centric innovation strategy, to promote co-production health 
      policies aiming at CVD prevention. METHODS: A mixed-method systematic literature 
      review was conducted in the fields of health and healthcare management to 
      highlight the intersections between PASA promotion and m-health tools in 
      fostering co-produced services focused on CVD prevention. The literature has been 
      extracted by the PRISMA logic application. The resulting sample has been first 
      statistically described by a bibliometric approach and then further investigated 
      with a conceptual analysis of the most relevant contributions, which have been 
      qualitatively analysed. RESULTS: We identified 2,295 studies, on which we ran the 
      bibliometric analysis. After narrowing the research around the co-production 
      field, we found 10 papers relevant for the concept analysis of contents. The 
      interest about the theme has increased in the last two decades, with a high 
      prevalence of contributions from higher income countries and those with higher 
      CVD incidence. The field of research is highly multi-disciplinary; most of 
      documents belong to the medical field, with only a few interconnections with the 
      technology and health policy spheres. Although the involvement of patients is 
      recognized as fundamental for CVD prevention through PASA, co-design schemes are 
      still lacking at the public management level. CONCLUSIONS: While the link between 
      the subjects of motor activity, medicine and technology is clear, the involvement 
      of citizens in the service delivery process is still underinvestigated, 
      especially the issue concerning how "value co-creation" could effectively be 
      applied by public agencies. In synthesis, the analysis of the role of 
      co-production as a system coordination method, which is so important in designing 
      and implementing preventive care, is still lacking.

AB  - Applications of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) assist both 
      health care providers and patients in cardiovascular education, complementing 
      traditional learning methods. Interventionalists have successfully used VR to 
      plan difficult procedures and AR to facilitate complex interventions. VR/AR has 
      already been used to treat patients, during interventions in rehabilitation 
      programs and in immobilized intensive care patients. There are numerous 
      additional potential applications in the catheterization laboratory. By using AR, 
      interventionalists could combine visual fluoroscopy information projected and 
      registered on the patient body with data derived from preprocedural imaging and 
      live fusion of different imaging modalities such as fluoroscopy with 
      echocardiography. Persistent technical challenges to overcome include the 
      integration of different imaging modalities into VR/AR and the harmonization of 
      data flow and interfaces. Cybersickness might exclude some patients and users 
      from the potential benefits of VR/AR. Critical ethical considerations arise in 
      the application of VR/AR in vulnerable patients. In addition, digital 
      applications must not distract physicians from the patient. It is our duty as 
      physicians to participate in the development of these innovations to ensure a 
      virtual health reality benefit for our patients in a real-world setting. The 
      purpose of this review is to summarize the current and future role of VR and AR 
      in different fields within cardiology, its challenges, and perspectives.

TI  - Trends in the Use of Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Mixed Reality in 
      Surgical Research: a Global Bibliometric and Visualized Analysis.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1007/s12262-021-03243-w [doi]
AB  - There have been many major developments in the use of augmented reality (AR), 
      virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR) technologies in the context of 
      global surgical research, yet few reports on the trends in this field have been 
      published to date. This study was therefore designed to explore these worldwide 
      trends in this clinically important field. Relevant studies published from 1 
      January 2009 through 13 October 2020 were retrieved from the Science Citation 
      Index-Expanded (SCI-E) tool of the Web of Science database. Bibliometric 
      techniques were then used to analyze the resultant data, with visual 
      bibliographic coupling, co-authorship, co-citation, co-occurrence, and 
      publication trend analyses subsequently being conducted with GraphPad Prism 8 and 
      with the visualization of similarities (VOS) software tool. There is no patient 
      and public involved. In total, 6221 relevant studies were incorporated into this 
      analysis. At a high level, clear global annual increases in the number of 
      publications in this field were observed. The USA made the greatest contributions 
      to this field over the studied period, with the highest H-index value, the most 
      citations, and the greatest total link strength for analyzed publications. The 
      country with the highest number of average citations per publication was 
      Scotland. The Surgical Endoscopy And Other Interventional Techniques journal 
      contributed the greatest number of publications in this field. The University of 
      London was the institution that produced the greatest volume of research in this 
      field. Overall, studies could be broadly classified into five clusters: 
      Neurological Research, Surgical Techniques, Technological Products, 
      Rehabilitative Medicine, and Clinical Therapy. The trends detected in the present 
      analysis suggest that the number of global publications pertaining to the use of 
      AR, VR, and MR techniques in surgical research is likely to increase in the 
      coming years. Particular attention should be paid to emerging trends in related 
      fields including MR, extended reality, head-mounted displays, navigation, and 
      holographic images.

TI  - A Preoperative Virtual Reality App for Patients Scheduled for Cardiac 
      Catheterization: Pre-Post Questionnaire Study Examining Feasibility, Usability, 
      and Acceptability.
PG  - e29473

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre- and postoperative anxiety is a common phenomenon associated with 
      negative postoperative outcomes. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, such 
      as fear, nightmares, and sleep deprivation, are prevalent in approximately 30% to 
      50% of patients following discharge from intensive care units after cardiac 
      surgery. Preliminary evidence suggests a promising role of virtual reality (VR) 
      in preventing stress-related reactions using stress inoculation training. Such 
      training enables cognitive preparation of individuals for stressful situations, 
      thereby becoming more tolerant and resistant to stress, subsequently reducing the 
      risk of potential negative psychological consequences. This study investigated a 
      preoperative VR app-Pre-View-aimed at better informing and preparing patients for 
      cardiac catheterization. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility, 
      usability, and acceptability of Pre-View in patients undergoing cardiac 
      catheterization. METHODS: Eligible participants were adults scheduled for 
      elective cardiac catheterization. Pre-View comprised an interactive virtual 
      representation of the whole care process related to cardiac catheterization, from 
      entering the hospital for admission to postprocedural stay and discharge. These 
      processes were represented through 360° videos and interactive photos. 
      Self-report questionnaires were completed at baseline (ie, before catheterization 
      and after undergoing the VR experience) and after cardiac catheterization. 
      Outcome measures included user experience and satisfaction, VR presence and 
      immersive tendencies, and user friendliness. The perceived effectiveness was 
      assessed exploratively. RESULTS: A total of 8 individuals, with a mean age of 67 
      (SD 7.5) years, participated in this study. Half of them underwent the VR 
      experience at the hospital and the other half at home. Participants reported high 
      levels of presence in the virtual environment (Presence Questionnaire score: mean 
      129.1, SD 13.4). The usability of Pre-View was well evaluated (System Usability 
      Scale score: mean 89.1, SD 12.0), and patient satisfaction was high (Client 
      Satisfaction Questionnaire score: mean 27.1, SD 3.2). Usability and satisfaction 
      scores were higher for participants who underwent Pre-View at home versus those 
      who underwent Pre-View at the hospital, although the latter group was 
      significantly older; 72.8 versus 61.3, respectively. All participants reported 
      Pre-View to be effective in terms of feeling better informed about the care 
      process of cardiac catheterization. Most participants (7/8, 88%) reported 
      Pre-View to be effective in terms of feeling better prepared for cardiac 
      catheterization, acknowledging the potential of Pre-View in reducing negative 
      psychological consequences after catheterization. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      provide initial support for the feasibility and acceptability of a preoperative 
      VR app, creating a virtual environment that supports patient education and 
      preparation for upcoming cardiac catheterization. More studies are needed to 
      further investigate the effects of VR as a tool to better prepare patients for 
      medical procedures, its effectiveness in reducing negative patient outcomes (eg, 
      anxiety, stress, and postoperative recovery outcomes), and the generalizability 
      of effects across different settings and patient populations.

TI  - Efficacy of virtual reality techniques in cardiopulmonary resuscitation training: 
      protocol for a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and trial sequential 
      analysis.
PG  - e058827
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058827 [doi]
LID - e058827
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the most critical procedure 
      in the rescue of patients with sudden cardiac death (SCD). The success rate of 
      CPR remains far below expectations, which made CPR education identified as the 
      top priority for SCD. CPR training using the virtual reality (VR) technique is a 
      feasible training method, with a wider population and lower cost, but its 
      efficacy remains controversial. Thus, we will perform a protocol for a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis to identify the efficacy of the VR technique on CPR 
      quality. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane 
      Library, Ovid Medline, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese 
      BioMedical Literature, Wanfang and VIP databases from inception to November 2021, 
      to identify randomised controlled trials and the first period in randomised 
      cross-over trials assessing the efficacy of VR techniques versus non-VR 
      techniques for adult participants accepting adult CPR training. No language 
      restrictions will be considered. Data synthesis will be performed using RevMan 
      V.5.4 and Stata/MP V.16.0. Outcome measures will be present as relative risk with 
      95% CIs for dichotomous data and mean difference with 95% CIs for continuous 
      data. The primary outcome will be the CPR quality defined as chest compression 
      rate and depth. Secondary outcomes will be the overall performance of CPR. 
      Heterogeneity will be assessed by the χ(2) test and I(2) statistic. Data will be 
      synthesised by either fixed-effects or random-effects models according to the 
      I(2) value. Trial sequential analysis and modified Jadad Scale will be used to 
      control the risks of random errors and evaluate the evidence quality. Egger's 
      regression test and funnel plots will be used to assess the publication bias. 
      ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was not required for this systematic 
      review protocol. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed 
      publications. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42021281059.

TI  - Cardiac Autonomic Modulation in Subjects with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) 
      during an Upper Limb Virtual Reality Task: A Prospective Control Trial.
PG  - 4439681

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease. As a result 
      of the rapid progression and severity of the disease, people with ALS experience 
      loss of functionality and independence. Furthermore, it has already been 
      described presence of autonomic dysfunction. Despite the increasing use of 
      virtual reality (VR) in the treatment of different diseases, the use of virtual 
      reality environment as an intervention program for ALS patients is innovative. 
      The benefits and limitations have not yet been proven. Our objective was to 
      evaluate the autonomic function of individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      throughout the virtual reality task. The analysis of autonomic function was 
      completed before, during, and after the virtual reality task using the upper 
      limbs; also, all steps lasted ten minutes in a sitting position. Heart rate 
      variability (HRV) was taken via the Polar® RS800CX cardiofrequencymeter. The 
      following questionnaire was enforced: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional 
      Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Different types 
      of HRV were revealed for the groups, indicating that the ALS group has reduced 
      HRV, with most of the representative indices of the sympathetic nervous system. 
      Besides, the physiological process of reducing parasympathetic activity from rest 
      to VR activity (vagal withdrawal), with reduction in HF (ms(2)) and an increase 
      in HR from rest to activity, and a further increase throughout recovery, with 
      withdrawal of sympathetic nervous system, occurs just for the control group (CG), 
      with no alterations between rest, activity, and recovery in individuals with ALS. 
      We could conclude that patients with ALS have the reduction of HRV with the 
      sympathetic predominance when equated to the healthy CG. Besides that, the ALS 
      individuals have no capability to adapt the autonomic nervous system when likened 
      to the CG during therapy based on VR and their recovery.

TI  - Feasibility and preliminary efficacy of perioperative interventions in patients 
      undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting: the randomized controlled I-COPE 
      trial.
LID - ezac041 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are 
      exposed to multiple treatment-related stressors, which can impact coping and 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The objective of this trial was to 
      analyse the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a multi-component 
      intervention that combines psychological support and reduction of 
      hospital-specific stressors on HRQoL, length of hospital and intensive care unit 
      stay, self-efficacy, and plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and -8 levels in CABG 
      patients. METHODS: This three-arm, randomized controlled, single-centre pilot 
      trial assessed the Intervention for CABG to Optimize Patient Experience in 88 
      patients undergoing elective CABG. Standard medical care (SMC, n = 29) was 
      compared with 2 intervention groups: (i) psychological interventions to optimize 
      treatment expectations (IA group, n = 30) and (ii) multi-component intervention 
      (IB group, n = 29) with psychological interventions plus an additional treatment 
      package (light therapy, noise reduction, music, and if desired, 360° images 
      delivered via virtual reality). RESULTS: The implementation of psychological 
      interventions in routine medical treatment was feasible (91.5% of participants 
      completed all intervention sessions). Both interventions were associated with 
      significantly shorter hospital stay compared to SMC (IA/IB 9.8/9.3 days vs SMC 
      12.5 days). Self-efficacy expectations at post-surgery were significantly higher 
      compared to SMC both in the IA group (P = 0.011) and marginally in the IB group 
      (P = 0.051). However, there were no treatment effects of the interventions on 
      HRQoL and plasma levels of IL-6 or IL-8 after CABG. CONCLUSIONS: A perioperative 
      multi-component intervention may lead to shorter hospital stay and higher 
      self-efficacy after CABG. Further studies are needed to determine its impact on 
      HRQoL and inflammation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Ethical approval (# 
      21/2/18) for the study was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of the 
      University of Göttingen Medical Center, and the trial was registered in the 
      German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00015309, 
      https://www.drks.de/drks_web/setLocale_EN.do).

      Planning makes perfect.
PG  - e05392
LID - 10.1002/ccr3.5392 [doi]

AB  - Transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve replacement (TMViVR) in degenerated 
      bioprostheses or valvular rings shows promise as an alternative to surgical MVR 
      in selected high-risk patients. However, these procedures are particularly 
      challenging given the complex anatomy of the mitral valve apparatus and the 
      surrounding structures, potentially causing LV outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). 
      Preprocedural planning with virtual implantation and planimetric estimation of 
      the neo-LVOT at end-systole is crucial for improving procedural results. In this 
      case, we also include a dynamic evaluation of the neo-LVOT and implement virtual 
      reality imaging for immersive assessment of the implanted valve.

      competency-based curriculum in Pakistan - a short innovation report.
PG  - S103-S105
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.AKU-21 [doi]
AB  - Simulation is a commonly utilized technique in healthcare education as it 
      provides trainees a realistic, but safe, environment to learn a variety of 
      skills. Trainees belonging to fields known for high stakes with low margins for 
      error, such as cardiac surgery, can greatly benefit from simulation-based 
      education. We propose the establishment of the first multi-tier high fidelity 
      cardiac surgery simulation lab with a structured curriculum that will eventually 
      provide multidisciplinary training to promising cardiac surgeons across Pakistan. 
      The simulation lab may also be used for research, grant acquisition and patent 
      development. Our setup will include the following levels of simulation: a simple 
      bench model, a virtual reality simulator and a unique human performance 
      simulator. Our multitiered approach allows for appropriate sequential trainee 
      skill progression. Finally, we hope that our model inspires the development of 
      similar curricula and modules for trainees belonging to other surgical fields.

AB  - Until now, the application of virtual reality as a distraction model has been 
      widely described in the medical field, showing different benefits offered on 
      patient's perception, particularly related to pain and anxiety. Previous clinical 
      experience of virtual reality applications on surgical intervention has shown how 
      during procedures with local anaesthesia, this modality improves patients' 
      experience without changing times, costs, and clinical outcomes. Herein, we 
      report our experience with three patients during diagnostic cardiac 
      catheterisation, showing the effect of this technology on patients' perception 
      and metrics during the procedure.

      understanding of the pathology, accuracy of details, quality of the anatomical 
      representation and technical operability and assessment of possible change in 
      treatment in different disciplines and levels of professional experience. 
      METHODS: Interviews were conducted with twenty physicians from the disciplines of 
      cardiology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthopedic surgery, and radiology 
      between 2018 and 2020 at the University Hospital of Basel. They were all 
      presented with three different three-dimensional clinical cases derived from CT 
      data from their area of expertise, one case for each method. During this, the 
      physicians were asked for their feedback written down on a pencil and paper 
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Concerning the understanding of the pathology and quality 
      of the anatomical representation, VR-Glasses were rated best in three out of four 
      disciplines and two out of three levels of professional experience. Regarding the 
      accuracy of details, 3D-Display was rated best in three out of four disciplines 
      and all levels of professional experience. As to operability, 3D-Display was 
      consistently rated best in all levels of professional experience and all 
      disciplines. Possible change in treatment was reported using 3D-Print in 33%, 
      VR-Glasses in 44%, and 3D-Display in 33% of participants. Physicians with a 
      professional experience of more than ten years reported no change in treatment 
      using any method. CONCLUSIONS: 3D-Print, VR-Glasses, and 3D-Displays are very 
      well accepted, and a relevant percentage of participants with less than ten years 
      of professional work experience could imagine a possible change in treatment 
      using any of these three-dimensional methods. Our findings challenge scientists, 
      technicians, and physicians to further develop these methods to improve the 
      three-dimensional understanding of pathologies and to add value to the education 
      of young and inexperienced physicians.

TI  - Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography-Guided Valve Sizing for Transcatheter 
      Pulmonary Valve Replacement.
LID - 10.3791/63367 [doi]
AB  - The measurements of the right ventricle (RV) and pulmonary artery (PA), for 
      selecting the optimal prosthesis size for transcatheter pulmonary valve 
      replacement (TPVR), vary considerably. Three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography 
      (CT) imaging for device size prediction is insufficient to assess the 
      displacement of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and PA, which could 
      increase the risk of stent misplacement and paravalvular leak. The aim of this 
      study is to provide a dynamic model to visualize and quantify the anatomy of the 
      RVOT to PA over the entire cardiac cycle by four-dimensional (4D) cardiac CT 
      reconstruction to obtain an accurate quantitative evaluation of the required 
      valve size. In this pilot study, cardiac CT from sheep J was chosen to illustrate 
      the procedures. 3D cardiac CT was imported into 3D reconstruction software to 
      build a 4D sequence which was divided into eleven frames over the cardiac cycle 
      to visualize the deformation of the heart. Diameter, cross-sectional area, and 
      circumference of five imaging planes at the main PA, sinotubular junction, sinus, 
      basal plane of the pulmonary valve (BPV), and RVOT were measured at each frame in 
      4D straightened models prior to valve implantation to predict the valve size. 
      Meanwhile, dynamic changes in the RV volume were also measured to evaluate right 
      ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF). 3D measurements at the end of the diastole 
      were obtained for comparison with the 4D measurements. In sheep J, 4D CT 
      measurements from the straightened model resulted in the same choice of valve 
      size for TPVR (30 mm) as 3D measurements. The RVEF of sheep J from pre-CT was 
      62.1 %. In contrast with 3D CT, the straightened 4D reconstruction model not only 
      enabled accurate prediction for valve size selection for TPVR but also provided 
      an ideal virtual reality, thus presenting a promising method for TPVR and the 
      innovation of TPVR devices.

TI  - Extended, virtual and augmented reality in thoracic surgery: a systematic review.
PG  - 201-211
LID - 10.1093/icvts/ivab241 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Extended reality (XR), encompassing both virtual reality (VR) and 
      augmented reality, allows the user to interact with a computer-generated 
      environment based on reality. In essence, the immersive nature of VR and 
      augmented reality technology has been warmly welcomed in all aspects of medicine, 
      gradually becoming increasingly feasible to incorporate into everyday practice. 
      In recent years, XR has become increasingly adopted in thoracic surgery, although 
      the extent of its applications is unclear. Here, we aim to review the current 
      applications of XR in thoracic surgery. METHODS: A systematic database search was 
      conducted of original articles that explored the use of VR and/or augmented 
      reality in thoracic surgery in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane database and Google 
      Scholar, from inception to December 2020. RESULTS: Our search yielded 1494 
      citations, of which 21 studies published from 2007 to 2019 were included in this 
      review. Three main areas were identified: (i) the application of XR in thoracic 
      surgery training; (ii) preoperative planning of thoracic procedures; and (iii) 
      intraoperative assistance. Overall, XR could produce progression along the 
      learning curve, enabling trainees to reach acceptable standards before performing 
      in the operating theatre. Preoperatively, through the generation of 3D-renderings 
      of the thoracic cavity and lung anatomy, VR increases procedural accuracy and 
      surgical confidence through familiarization of the patient's anatomy. XR-assisted 
      surgery may have therapeutic use particularly for complex cases, where 
      conventional methods would yield inadequate outcomes due to inferior accuracy. 
      CONCLUSION: XR represents a salient step towards improving thoracic surgical 
      training, as well as enhancing preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance.

TI  - Validation of Virtual Imaging of a Dynamic, Functioning Aortic Valve Using an 
      Ex-vivo Porcine Heart.
LID - S0003-4975(22)00019-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2021.11.070 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate a virtual reality imaging system in terms of 
      visualization accuracy and appropriate orientation when displaying cardiac 
      anatomy, we used an ex-vivo model enabling direct comparison between 
      reconstructed three-dimensional visualization of intracardiac structures and 
      real-time visual images. DESCRIPTION: We established a systole-diastole platform 
      using a swine heart activated by an external mechanical pump and reservoir, 
      allowing simultaneous acquisition of endoscopic visual and computed tomography 
      (CT) images of the aortic valve. Virtual images were processed from CT data using 
      Vesalius 3D software and compared with visual images seen through a fiberoptic 
      scope. EVALUATION: An endoscope gave a fine view of the aortic valve, while the 
      virtual images elucidated the valve structures. Superimposition of the images 
      from those two different modalities showed the virtual reality images precisely 
      matching the visual images in both systole and diastole, confirming the validity 
      of this virtual reality application. CONCLUSION: In view of this demonstrated 
      fidelity of virtual imaging, this technology may be of sufficiently high quality 
      to be considered a gold standard for cardiac anatomy.

      controlled study.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1017/S104795112100500X [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study explored the effects of condition notification based on 
      virtual reality technology on the anxiety levels of parents of children with 
      simple CHD. METHODS: The subjects of the study were the parents of 60 children 
      with simple CHD who were treated in our centre. The state anxiety scale was used 
      to assess the anxiety status of the parents of the children before and after the 
      condition notification in different ways (based on virtual reality explanations 
      and written explanations). RESULTS: In this study, a total of 55 parents of 
      children with CHD successfully completed the survey. At the time of admission, 
      there was no significant difference in the state anxiety scale scores of the 
      parents between the two groups. The anxiety status of the virtual reality group 
      was relieved after the condition notification assisted by virtual reality 
      technology, and there was a significant difference compared with the control 
      group. CONCLUSION: Condition notification based on virtual reality technology can 
      effectively alleviate the anxiety of parents of children with simple CHD, which 
      is worthy of clinical application.

TI  - Comparison of a virtual reality compression-only Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 
      (CPR) course to the traditional course with content validation of the VR course - 
      A randomized control pilot study.
PG  - 103241

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Technology has been a major contributor to recent changes in 
      education, where simulation plays a huge role by providing a unique safe 
      environment, especially with the recent incorporation of immersive virtual 
      reality (VR) training. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) is said to double, 
      even triple survival from cardiac arrest, and hence it is crucial to ensure 
      optimal acquisition and retention of these skills. In this study, we aim to 
      compare a VR CPR teaching program to current teaching methods with content 
      validation of the VR course. METHODS: A randomized single-blinded 
      simulation-based pilot study where 26 participants underwent baseline assessment 
      of their CPR skills using a validated checklist and Laerdal QCPR®. Participants 
      were randomly allocated and underwent their respective courses. This was followed 
      by a final assessment and a questionnaire for content validation, knowledge and 
      confidence. The data was analysed using STATA 16.2 to determine the standardized 
      mean difference using paired and unpaired t-test. RESULTS: Subjective assessment 
      using the checklist showed statistically significant improvement in the overall 
      scores of both groups (traditional group mean improved from 6.92 to 9.61 p-value 
      0.0005, VR group from 6.61 to 8.53 p-value 0.0016). However, no statistically 
      significant difference was noted between the final scores in both the subjective 
      and objective assessments. As for the questionnaire, knowledge and confidence 
      seemed to improve equally. Finally, the content validation showed statistically 
      significant improvement in ease of use (mean score 3 to 4.23 p-value of 0.0144), 
      while for content, positivity of experience, usefulness and appropriateness 
      participants showed similar satisfaction before and after use. CONCLUSION: This 
      pilot study suggests that VR teaching could deliver CPR skills in an attractive 
      manner, with no inferiority in acquisition of these skills compared to 
      traditional methods. To corroborate these findings, we suggest a follow-up study 
      with a larger sample size after adding ventilation and Automated External 
      Defibrillator (AED) skills to the VR course with re-examination after 3-6 months 
      to test retention of the skills.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Traditional approaches to stress management are difficult to learn 
      and to implicate in daily life. Emerging technologies like virtual reality (VR) 
      have become a target of extensive study for recreational and medical purposes. 
      The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a crucial role in stress response, 
      post-stress relaxation, and recovery. This study aimed to assess the effect of 
      modified VR intervention on short-term heart rate variability (HRV) and perceived 
      anxiety levels in healthy volunteers affected by moderate stress. The stressors 
      included mental arithmetic tasks. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 
      healthy adults, of both sexes, aged 20 to 60 years, without history of 
      cardiovascular diseases, essential abnormalities on ECG, and with normal or 
      moderate level of situational anxiety. The VR gadgets used in the study were 
      commercially available Bobo-VR X1 headsets, one with modification for medical 
      applications (Pure Purr technology) and one with none (sham technology). The 
      investigational (Pure Purr) headset with an audio-visual sequence was modified by 
      adding a binaural effect and was synchronised with the tract of respiratory 
      movements and the frequency of heart rate. To track changes in the ANS, 
      participants underwent both electrocardiography (ECG) and measurement of HRV. 
      RESULTS: The findings showed a significant increase in parasympathetic activity 
      after 5-minute exposure to the investigational device compared to stress, as 
      shown by high-frequency HRV (499.8 ms(2) and 340.5 ms(2), p < 0.001). RMSSD for a 
      modified headset was higher (p = 0.02) compared to a sham headset with no 
      modifications (RMSSD difference of 12.3% (2.6% to 23.1%)). The LF/HF ratio, 
      however, was lower (difference of 14.5% (2.6% to 23.1%), p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings suggest that a medical device with pre-installed Pure Purr 
      software had a significant effect on the recovery of the ANS in healthy 
      volunteers affected by moderate stress.

TI  - Virtual reality and hypnosis for anxiety and pain management in intensive care 
      units: A prospective randomised trial among cardiac surgery patients.
PG  - 58-66
LID - 10.1097/EJA.0000000000001633 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality and hypnosis are little studied in complex contexts, 
      such as intensive care, where patients need significant physical and 
      psychological assistance. OBJECTIVES: To compare and combine hypnosis and virtual 
      reality benefits on anxiety and pain on patients before and after cardiac 
      surgery. DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled clinical trial. SETTING: The 
      study was conducted in the University Hospital of Liege (Belgium) from October 
      2018 to January 2020. PATIENTS: One hundred patients (66 ± 11.5 years; 24 women, 
      76 men) were included. Participants were adults undergoing cardiac surgery. 
      Exclusion criteria: psychiatric diseases, claustrophobia, acrophobia, hearing 
      loss, visual impairment, extreme fatigue, confusion surgery cancelled. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to four arms (control; hypnosis; 
      virtual reality; virtual reality hypnosis) and had 20 min of one of the 
      techniques the day before and the day after surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: 
      Anxiety, pain, fatigue, relaxation, physiological parameters, and opioid use were 
      evaluated before and after each session. RESULTS: The main results did not show 
      any significant differences between the groups. In all groups, anxiety decreased 
      and pain increased from baseline to the postoperative day. Relaxation increased 
      in all groups in the pre-operative (P < 0.0001) and postoperative period 
      (P = 0.03). There were no significant differences for fatigue, physiological 
      measures, or opioid use. CONCLUSION: As there were no significant differences 
      between groups for the measured variables, we cannot affirm that one technique is 
      better than another. Additional studies are required to compare and evaluate the 
      cost-effectiveness of these techniques for critical care patients and caregivers.

TI  - Past Present and Future of Simulation in Internal Medicine.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Simulation training has its roots in the aviation industry, with the first flight 
      simulators built in the 1930s. The military, NASA, and commercial airlines 
      further pioneered simulation techniques to improve pilot training and safety. The 
      field of medicine implemented forms of simulation for training as early as the 
      1950s, but it wasn’t until the turn of the century that medical simulation took 
      off. Anesthesia was an early adopter of simulation; a first simulator appeared in 
      the 1960s, which could reproduce some physiology, respond to drugs, and teach 
      basic airway management. Since then, medical simulation has expanded across all 
      disciplines of medicine. In particular, internal medicine residencies are 
      increasingly making use of simulation to teach their house-staff, mediate 
      deficiencies, and maintain proficiency in key areas of practice. The medical 
      simulation utilizes multiple diverse modalities to teach learners in internal 
      medicine. For example, scenarios with standardized patients are often used to 
      assess interpersonal skills and communication; while task trainers, cadavers and 
      animal models are employed to replicate procedures without putting patients at 
      risk; and medical emergencies are simulated with interactive software, virtual 
      reality, and high fidelity mannequins which have led to improved patient survival 
      in some cases. Debriefing, which occurs at the end of the simulation, is a key 
      aspect of learning, soliciting learner self-reflection, and uncovering the ways 
      they think about and approach medical problems. Simulation is poised to expand in 
      the future. Much like aircraft pilots are routinely tested for proficiency and 
      ability to handle emergency situations during their careers, medical boards are 
      starting to use simulation to assess clinical competency. For instance, the 
      American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) offers the option of a simulated 
      cardiac catheterization skills assessment to interventional cardiologists to 
      maintain their certification in this procedure. Similarly, the American Board of 
      Anesthesiology board exam incorporates an Objective Structured Clinical 
      Examination (OSCE) to assess communication, professionalism, and technical 
      skills. These offerings will likely expand to internal medicine and other 
      specialties. Another growing and evolving area of simulation is virtual reality, 
      which will have an increasing application to all fields of medicine; sight, 
      sound, and new functions such as haptics provide an immersive world for learners 
      to develop clinical skills. Interprofessional simulation is useful to understand 
      and improve team dynamics and communication and is particularly important to the 
      role of the internal medicine physician who is tasked with coordinating patient 
      care. And beyond training and education, simulation has real-world implications, 
      including improved patient safety and healthcare quality.

AB  - Understanding the lead trajectory is important in preventing complications after 
      cardiac rhythm device implantation. In this report, we sought to reconstruct the 
      three-dimensional (3D) shape of a pacing lead from radiographs taken at 90-degree 
      angles. All image data were obtained from a 65-year-old male patient, who 
      underwent pacemaker implantation at our hospital due to third-degree 
      atrioventricular block in 2016. Both frontal and lateral chest X-rays were taken 
      just after the device implantation (supine position) and on the post-procedural 
      day 1 (upright position), respectively. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
      emission tomography/CT was performed 75 days after the pacemaker implantation for 
      the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis. Contours of the ventricular leads were 
      manually traced in each X-ray image and saved as Scalable Vector Format (SVG) 
      files using the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). The 3D reconstruction was 
      performed on Blender 2.93, which is an open-source computer graphics software. 
      The lead trajectory could be reconstructed from bidirectional radiographs, which 
      may allow for further investigation of the 3D shape change of the pacemaker 
      leads.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training for the 
      general public involves the use of a manikin and a training video, which has 
      limitations related to a lack of realism and immersion. To overcome these 
      limitations, virtual reality and extended reality technologies are being used in 
      the field of medical education. The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy 
      and safety of extended reality (XR)-based basic life support (BLS) training. 
      METHODS: This study is a prospective, multinational, multicentre, randomised 
      controlled study. Four institutions in 4 countries will participate in the study. 
      A total of 154 participants will be randomly assigned to either the XR group or 
      the conventional group stratified by institution and sex (1:1 ratio). Each 
      participant who is allocated to either group will be sent to a separate room to 
      receive training with an XR BLS module or conventional CPR training video. All 
      participants will perform a test on a CPR manikin after the training. The primary 
      outcome will be mean compression depth. The secondary outcome will be overall BLS 
      performance, including compression rate, correct hand position, compression, and 
      full release and hands-off time. DISCUSSION: Using virtual reality (VR) to 
      establish a virtual educational environment can give trainees a sense of realism. 
      In the XR environment, which combines the virtual world with the real world, 
      trainees can more effectively learn various skills. This trial will provide 
      evidence of the usefulness of XR in CPR education. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04736888. Registered on 29 January 2021.

TI  - Design of a Virtual Reality Interactive Training System for Public Health 
      Emergency Preparedness for Major Emerging Infectious Diseases: Theory and 
      Framework.
PG  - e29956
LID - 10.2196/29956 [doi]
LID - e29956
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sufficient public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) is the key 
      factor in effectively responding to and recovering from major emerging infectious 
      diseases (MEIDs). However, in the face of MEIDs, PHEP is insufficient, so it is 
      necessary to improve PHEP. The rapid development of virtual reality and 
      human-computer interaction provides unprecedented opportunities for innovative 
      educational methods. OBJECTIVE: This study designed a virtual reality interactive 
      training system (VRITS) to provide an effective path for improving PHEP in the 
      context of MEIDs so that the public can effectively respond to and recover from 
      MEIDs. METHODS: This study used interactive narrative, situated learning and 
      human-computer interaction theories as a theoretical framework to guide the 
      design of the system. We used the literature research method and the Delphi 
      method; consulted multidisciplinary experts, such as infectious diseases, disease 
      control, psychology, and public health personnel, to determine the educational 
      content framework; and set up an interdisciplinary team to construct an operating 
      system framework for the VRITS. RESULTS: We named the VRITS "People's War Against 
      Pandemic." The educational content framework includes 20 knowledge, emotion, and 
      behavior skills in 5 aspects (cooperating with prevention and control work, 
      improving emergency response ability, guaranteeing supplies and equipment, 
      preparing economic resources, and maintaining physical and mental health). The 
      operating system framework includes virtual interactive training, knowledge 
      corner, intelligent evaluation, and community forum modules, and the core module 
      is the virtual interactive training module. In this module, users control virtual 
      characters to move in various scenes, and then identify and analyze the 
      controllability and harmfulness of the evolving pandemic and select the correct 
      prevention and control strategy to avoid infecting themselves and others. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The development and sharing of the multidisciplinary theoretical 
      framework adopted by People's War Against Pandemic can help us clarify the design 
      ideas and assumptions of the VRITS; predict training results; understand the 
      ability of training to change emergency knowledge, emergency emotion, and 
      behavioral responses to MEIDs; and promote the development of more effective 
      training systems based on virtual reality.

TI  - Comparison of cardiac autonomic modulation of athletes and non-athletes 
      individuals with spinal cord injury at rest and during a non-immersive virtual 
      reality task.
PG  - 1294-1300
LID - 10.1038/s41393-021-00722-5 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVES: To compare cardiac autonomic 
      modulation of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) that practice different 
      amounts of moderate to vigorous physical activity (PA) and able-bodied controls 
      at rest and during a non-immersive Virtual Reality task. SETTING: Athletes with 
      SCI of wheelchair basketball, wheelchair tennis, wheelchair handball, WCMX 
      (wheelchair motocross), and para-swimming were assessed at the Faca na Cadeira 
      Institute, ICEL and Clube Espéria in São Paulo, Brazil; non-athletes with SCI and 
      able-bodied controls were assessed at the Acreditando Centro de Recuperação 
      Neuromotora, São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: One-hundred forty-five individuals were 
      assessed: 36 athletes with traumatic SCI (41.1 ± 16.8 years old), 52 non-athletes 
      with traumatic SCI (40.2 ± 14.1 years old), and 57 able-bodied individuals 
      (39.4 ± 12.5 years old). Cardiac autonomic modulation was assessed through heart 
      rate variability (HRV) measured in the sitting position at rest and during a VR 
      game activity. RESULTS: We found significantly more favourable HRV for athletes 
      with SCI when compared to non-athletes with SCI, but no differences between 
      athletes with SCI and able-bodied controls. In addition, athletes and able-bodied 
      controls showed adequate autonomic nervous system (ANS) adaptation (rest versus 
      physical activity in VR), i.e., they experienced parasympathetic withdrawal 
      during VR physical activity, which was not found in non-athletes with SCI. 
      CONCLUSION: The practice of moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated 
      with healthier cardiac autonomic modulation in adults with SCI, which may lead to 
      more favourable health outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov 
      Identifier: NCT04618003, retrospectively registered.

LID - 10.1002/jmor.21421 [doi]
AB  - Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) are new technologies with the power to 
      revolutionize the study of morphology. Modern imaging approaches such as computed 
      tomography, laser scanning, and photogrammetry have opened up a new digital 
      world, enabling researchers to share and analyze morphological data 
      electronically and in great detail. Because this digital data exists on a 
      computer screen, however, it can remain difficult to understand and unintuitive 
      to interact with. VR/AR technologies bridge the analog-to-digital divide by 
      presenting 3D data to users in a very similar way to how they would interact with 
      actual anatomy, while also providing a more immersive experience and greater 
      possibilities for exploration. This manuscript describes VR/AR hardware, 
      software, and techniques, and is designed to give practicing morphologists and 
      educators a primer on using these technologies in their research, pedagogy, and 
      communication to a wide variety of audiences. We also include a series of case 
      studies from the presentations and workshop given at the 2019 International 
      Congress of Vertebrate Morphology, and suggest best practices for the use of 
      VR/AR in comparative morphology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) constitutes a valid 
      paradigm for social stress induction, less is known about the effects of a 
      virtual reality (VR) TSST on short- and long-term hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
      (HPA) axis and sympathetic-adreno-medullar (SAM) axis responses. Hence, this 
      study set out to evaluate reactivity and habituation of self-reported stress and 
      HPA and SAM reactivity in a real TSST and VR-TSST when compared to a placebo 
      TSST. METHOD: Sixty-eight healthy young adults (50% female) were randomly 
      assigned to either a real TSST, a VR-TSST, or a placebo TSST, all of which were 
      conducted three times (one day and one week post initial exposure). Social 
      presence, self-reported stress, salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), and heart 
      rate variability (HRV) were analyzed using ANOVAs and multilevel models. 
      FINDINGS: On the first exposure, both the real and VR-TSST showed significantly 
      stronger cortisol and cardiovascular responses than the placebo. On the second 
      visit, the cortisol response was still significantly high-and the HRV response 
      low-for the real and VR-TSST. The third visit resulted in HR, HRV, and cortisol 
      responses comparable to the placebo group. Furthermore, the real TSST induced 
      more self-reported stress than the placebo on all three visits, the VR-TSST only 
      on the first two visits. Social presence was stable across conditions and had no 
      association with stress markers. CONCLUSION: These findings imply that the 
      replicability of stress exposures at shorter intervals seems problematic for the 
      traditional TSST, and for the VR-TSST.

AB  - Shape reconstruction from sparse point clouds/images is a challenging and 
      relevant task required for a variety of applications in computer vision and 
      medical image analysis (e.g. surgical navigation, cardiac motion analysis, 
      augmented/virtual reality systems). A subset of such methods, viz. 3D shape 
      reconstruction from 2D contours, is especially relevant for computer-aided 
      diagnosis and intervention applications involving meshes derived from multiple 2D 
      image slices, views or projections. We propose a deep learning architecture, 
      coined Mesh Reconstruction Network (MR-Net), which tackles this problem. MR-Net 
      enables accurate 3D mesh reconstruction in real-time despite missing data and 
      with sparse annotations. Using 3D cardiac shape reconstruction from 2D contours 
      defined on short-axis cardiac magnetic resonance image slices as an exemplar, we 
      demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 
      techniques for shape reconstruction from unstructured point clouds. Our approach 
      can reconstruct 3D cardiac meshes to within 2.5-mm point-to-point error, 
      concerning the ground-truth data (the original image spatial resolution is 
      ∼1.8×1.8×10mm(3)). We further evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach to 
      incomplete data, and contours estimated using an automatic segmentation 
      algorithm. MR-Net is generic and could reconstruct shapes of other organs, making 
      it compelling as a tool for various applications in medical image analysis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To measure and explore complex cardiac anatomy in research and 
      preoperative simulation, a virtual imaging technology-the Vesalius 3D suite (PS 
      Medtech, Amsterdam, Netherlands)-combines Vesalius three-dimensional (3D) 
      image-processing software with an optic-tracking navigation system running 
      PST-Client software. We present a novel method of evaluating dynamic aortic root 
      geometry in vivo using this visualization system. DESCRIPTION: Based on 
      electrocardiography-gated cardiac computed tomography data in systole and 
      diastole, images of the aortic root in a healthy adult were reconstructed for 3D 
      visualization. Virtual interaction tools were used to explore and measure the 
      aortic root structures. EVALUATION: Virtually reconstructed images revealed the 
      aortic root internal structures in exquisite detail. Highly accessible 3D 
      interpretation promptly permitted precise measurements of repair-relevant 
      anatomic parameters, including geometrically complex curves of the aortic root 
      wall and dynamic changes in the aortic valves. Measurement accuracy examined 
      against a known prosthesis showed within 1 mm of error (less than 0.5%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This technology may promote understanding of aortic root form and 
      function, and facilitate valve-sparing surgery, and seems valuable for 3D 
      exploration and measurement of cardiac anatomy in vivo.

TI  - Anaglyph stereo virtual dissection: a novel inexpensive method for stereoscopic 
      visualisation of intracardiac anatomy on CT angiogram.
PG  - 1958-1961
LID - 10.1017/S1047951121001323 [doi]
AB  - Three-dimensional visualisation is invaluable for evaluating cardiac anatomy. 
      Patient-specific three-dimensional printed models of the heart are useful but 
      require significant infrastructure. The three-dimensional virtual models, derived 
      from 3D echocardiography, computed tomographic (CT) angiography or cardiac 
      magnetic resonance (CMR), permit excellent visualisation of intracardiac anatomy, 
      but viewing on a two-dimensional screen obscures the third dimension. Various 
      forms of extended reality, such as virtual reality and augmented reality, augment 
      the third dimension but only using expensive equipment. Herein, we report a 
      simple technique of anaglyph stereoscopic visualisation of three-dimensional 
      virtual cardiac models. The feasibility of achieving stereovision on a personal 
      computer, using open-source software, and the need for inexpensive anaglyph 
      glasses for viewing make it extremely cost-effective. Further, the retained depth 
      perception of resulting stereo images in electronic and printed format makes 
      sharing with other members of the team easy and effective.

      a case report.

AB  - Atrial septal defects (ASDs) are the third most common type of congenital heart 
      diseases with ostium secundum defects (ASDsII) being responsible for 
      approximately 75% of these defects. The treatment consists of either a 
      transcatheter closure or a surgical intervention. The transcatheter approach 
      offers a less invasive alternative for patients who fulfill anatomical and size 
      criteria and is therefore increasingly used as the preferred primary 
      intervention. As general anaesthesia is sometimes contra-indicated for some 
      patients needing ASD or PFO closure and intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is 
      not always readily available, alternative "supportive" techniques as hypnosis 
      could be of interest. In our case, a relative contra-indication for general 
      anaesthesia was pronounced due to the severely impaired pulmonary function caused 
      by severe deformative torsional scoliosis. Over the years several reviews have 
      been published on hypnotic analgesia used together with usual care suggesting 
      that hypnotic analgesia is a promising non-pharmacologic adjunct treatment for 
      ameliorating pain and surgical distress. Also, various cardiological procedures 
      under hypnosis have already been described in literature, but this is the first 
      time that percutaneous ASD closure under virtual reality (VR) hypnosis is 
      mentioned in literature.

TI  - Using a 360° Virtual Reality or 2D Video to Learn History Taking and Physical 
      Examination Skills for Undergraduate Medical Students: Pilot Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - e13124
LID - 10.2196/13124 [doi]
LID - e13124
AB  - BACKGROUND: Learning through a 360° virtual reality (VR) or 2D video represents 
      an alternative way to learn a complex medical education task. However, there is 
      currently no consensus on how best to assess the effects of different learning 
      materials on cognitive load estimates, heart rate variability (HRV), outcomes, 
      and experience in learning history taking and physical examination (H&P) skills. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate how learning materials (ie, 
      VR or 2D video) impact learning outcomes and experience through changes in 
      cognitive load estimates and HRV for learning H&P skills. METHODS: This pilot 
      system-design study included 32 undergraduate medical students at an academic 
      teaching hospital. The students were randomly assigned, with a 1:1 allocation, to 
      a 360° VR video group or a 2D video group, matched by age, sex, and cognitive 
      style. The contents of both videos were different with regard to visual angle and 
      self-determination. Learning outcomes were evaluated using the Milestone 
      reporting form. Subjective and objective cognitive loads were estimated using the 
      Paas Cognitive Load Scale, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task 
      Load Index, and secondary-task reaction time. Cardiac autonomic function was 
      assessed using HRV measurements. Learning experience was assessed using the 
      AttrakDiff2 questionnaire and qualitative feedback. Statistical significance was 
      accepted at a two-sided P value of <.01. RESULTS: All 32 participants received 
      the intended intervention. The sample consisted of 20 (63%) males and 12 (38%) 
      females, with a median age of 24 (IQR 23-25) years. The 360° VR video group 
      seemed to have a higher Milestone level than the 2D video group (P=.04). The 
      reaction time at the 10th minute in the 360° VR video group was significantly 
      higher than that in the 2D video group (P<.001). Multiple logistic regression 
      models of the overall cohort showed that the 360° VR video module was 
      independently and positively associated with a reaction time at the 10th minute 
      of ≥3.6 seconds (exp B=18.8, 95% CI 3.2-110.8; P=.001) and a Milestone level of 
      ≥3 (exp B=15.0, 95% CI 2.3-99.6; P=.005). However, a reaction time at the 10th 
      minute of ≥3.6 seconds was not related to a Milestone level of ≥3. A 
      low-frequency to high-frequency ratio between the 5th and 10th minute of ≥1.43 
      seemed to be inversely associated with a hedonic stimulation score of ≥2.0 (exp 
      B=0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.68; P=.015) after adjusting for video module. The main 
      qualitative feedback indicated that the 360° VR video module was fun but caused 
      mild dizziness, whereas the 2D video module was easy to follow but tedious. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results showed that 360° VR video learning may be 
      associated with a better Milestone level than 2D video learning, and that this 
      did not seem to be related to cognitive load estimates or HRV indexes in the 
      novice learners. Of note, an increase in sympathovagal balance may have been 
      associated with a lower hedonic stimulation score, which may have met the 
      learners' needs and prompted learning through the different video modules. TRIAL

TI  - Cardiac Rehabilitation Early after Sternotomy Using New Assistive VR-Enhanced 
      Robotic Exoskeleton-Study Protocol for a Randomised Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182211922 [doi]
LID - 11922
AB  - (1) Background and objective: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) means delivering health 
      education by structured exercises with the means of risk reduction, in a 
      cost-effective manner. Well-conducted CR improves functional capacity, decreases 
      re-hospitalization, and reduces mortality up to 25%. We bring to attention the 
      protocol of a randomised control trial with the aim of validating the prototype 
      of an assistive upper-body robotic exoskeleton system enhanced with a 
      non-immersive virtual reality exergame (CardioVR-ReTone) in patients who 
      undergone cardiac surgery. (2) Methods: Description of the CardioVR-ReTone system 
      and the technical specification, followed by the group selection, randomization 
      and evaluated variables. (3) Expected results: The primary outcome measurement is 
      the modification of life quality at the end of the CR exercise training program. 
      Secondary outcomes will encompass measurements of sternal stability, muscular 
      activity, cardiac response to exercise, pain level and compliance/adherence to 
      CR. (4) Conclusions: Implementing these novel features of the CardioVR-ReTone 
      system, addressability, and efficacy of CR, so problematic in certain situations 
      and especially in cardiac surgery, will be greatly facilitated, being independent 
      of the skills and availability of the rehabilitation therapist.

TI  - 3D Virtual Reality Imaging of Major Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries: A Novel 
      Diagnostic Modality.
PG  - 765-772
LID - 10.1177/21501351211045064 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs), as seen in 
      patients with pulmonary atresia, are arteries that supply blood from the aorta to 
      the lungs and often require surgical intervention. To achieve complete repair in 
      the least number of interventions, optimal imaging of the pulmonary arterial 
      anatomy and MAPCAs is critical. 3D virtual reality (3D-VR) is a promising and 
      upcoming new technology that could potentially ameliorate current imaging 
      shortcomings. METHODS: A retrospective, proof-of-concept study was performed of 
      all operated patients with pulmonary atresia and MAPCAs at our center between 
      2010 and 2020 with a preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan. CT images were 
      reviewed by two congenital cardiac surgeons in 3D-VR to determine additional 
      value of VR for MAPCA imaging compared to conventional CT and for preoperative 
      planning of MAPCA repair. RESULTS: 3D-VR visualizations were reconstructed from 
      CT scans of seven newborns where the enhanced topographic anatomy resulted in 
      improved visualization of MAPCA. In addition, surgical planning was improved 
      since new observations or different preoperative plans were apparent in 4 out of 
      7 cases. After the initial setup, VR software and hardware was reported to be 
      easy and intuitive to use. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed technical feasibility 
      of 3D-VR reconstruction of children with immersive visualization of topographic 
      anatomy in an easy-to-use format leading to an improved surgical planning of 
      MAPCA surgery. Future prospective studies are required to investigate the 
      clinical benefits in larger populations.

AB  - In recent years, medical simulators have been widely applied to a broad range of 
      surgery training tasks. However, most of the existing surgery simulators can only 
      provide limited immersive environments with a few pre-processed organ models, 
      while ignoring the instant modeling of various personalized clinical cases, which 
      brings substantive differences between training experiences and real surgery 
      situations. To this end, we present a virtual reality (VR) based surgery 
      simulation system for personalized percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The 
      simulation system can directly take patient-specific clinical data as input and 
      generate virtual 3D intervention scenarios. Specially, we introduce a fiber-based 
      patient-specific cardiac dynamic model to simulate the nonlinear deformation 
      among the multiple layers of the cardiac structure, which can well respect and 
      correlate the atriums, ventricles and vessels, and thus gives rise to more 
      effective visualization and interaction. Meanwhile, we design a tracking and 
      haptic feedback hardware, which can enable users to manipulate physical 
      intervention instruments and interact with virtual scenarios. We conduct 
      quantitative analysis on deformation precision and modeling efficiency, and 
      evaluate the simulation system based on the user studies from 16 cardiologists 
      and 20 intervention trainees, comparing it to traditional desktop intervention 
      simulators. The results confirm that our simulation system can provide a better 
      user experience, and is a suitable platform for PCI surgery training and 
      rehearsal.

PG  - 1335-1347

AB  - Aim: Multiomics delivers more biological insight than targeted investigations. We 
      applied multiomics to patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection 
      fraction (HFrEF), with machine learning applied to advanced ECG (AECG) and 
      echocardiography artificial intelligence (Echo AI). Patients & methods: In total, 
      46 patients with HFrEF and 20 controls underwent metabolomic profiling, including 
      liquid/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and solid-phase 
      microextraction volatilomics in plasma and urine. HFrEF was defined using left 
      ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain, EF and N-terminal pro hormone BNP. 
      AECG and Echo AI were performed over 5 min, with a subset of patients undergoing 
      a virtual reality mental stress test. Results: A-ECG had similar diagnostic 
      accuracy as N-terminal pro hormone BNP for HFrEF (area under the curve = 0.95, 
      95% CI: 0.85-0.99), and correlated with global longitudinal strain (r = -0.77, 
      p < 0.0001), while Echo AI-generated measurements correlated well with manually 
      measured LV end diastolic volume r = 0.77, LV end systolic volume r = 0.8, LVEF 
      r = 0.71, indexed left atrium volume r = 0.71 and indexed LV mass r = 0.6, 
      p < 0.005. AI-LVEF and other HFrEF biomarkers had a similar discrimination for 
      HFrEF (area under the curve AI-LVEF = 0.88; 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.15; p = 0.19). 
      Virtual reality mental stress test elicited arrhythmic biomarkers on AECG and 
      indicated blunted autonomic responsiveness (alpha 2 of RR interval variability, 
      p = 1 × 10(-4)) in HFrEF. Conclusion: Multiomics-related machine learning shows 
      promise for the assessment of HF.

OAB - Lay abstract Multiomics is the integration of multiple sources of health 
      information, for example, genomic, metabolite, etc. This delivers more insight 
      than targeted single investigations and provides an ability to perceive subtle 
      individual differences between people. In this study we applied multiomics to 
      patients with heart failure (HF) using DNA sequencing, metabolomics and machine 
      learning applied to ECG echocardiography. We demonstrated significant differences 
      between subsets of patients with HF using these methods. We also showed that 
      machine learning has significant diagnostic potential in identifying HF patients 
      more efficiently than manual or conventional techniques.

AB  - A 28-month-old girl with multiple ventricular septal defects previously underwent 
      surgical and transcatheter attempts at repair. Three-dimensional models were 
      created from cardiac magnetic resonance-derived images. Viewing the models in 
      virtual reality allowed the team to precisely locate the defects and decide on a 
      hybrid transcatheter and surgical approach to ensure successful repair. (Level of 
      Difficulty: Advanced.).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Using fractional flow reserve (FFR) to guide percutaneous coronary 
      intervention for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) improves clinical 
      decision making but remains underused. Virtual FFR (vFFR), computed from 
      angiographic images, permits physiologic assessment without a pressure wire and 
      can be extended to virtual coronary intervention (VCI) to facilitate treatment 
      planning. This study investigated the effect of adding vFFR and VCI to 
      angiography in patient assessment and management. METHODS: Two cardiologists 
      independently reviewed clinical data and angiograms of 50 patients undergoing 
      invasive management of coronary syndromes, and their management plans were 
      recorded. The vFFRs were computed and disclosed, and the cardiologists submitted 
      revised plans. Then, using VCI, the physiologic results of various interventional 
      strategies were shown and further revision was invited. RESULTS: Disclosure of 
      vFFR led to a change in strategy in 27%. VCI led to a change in stent size in 
      48%. Disclosure of vFFR and VCI resulted in an increase in operator confidence in 
      their decision. Twelve cases were reviewed by 6 additional cardiologists. There 
      was limited agreement in the management plans between cardiologists based on 
      either angiography (kappa = 0.31) or vFFR (kappa = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: vFFR has 
      the potential to alter decision making, and VCI can guide stent sizing. However, 
      variability in management strategy remains considerable between operators, even 
      when presented with the same anatomic and physiologic data.

TI  - Preoperative Morphological Prediction of Early Reoperation Risk After Primary 
      Repair in Tetralogy of Fallot: A Contemporary Analysis of 83 Cases.
PG  - 1512-1525

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the pulmonary artery (PA) variations in 
      tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and preoperative morphological predictors for early 
      reoperation. Eighty-three TOF patients and 20 children with normal PA were 
      included. The TOF group was divided into two subsets according to whether or not 
      reoperation was performed within 3 years postoperatively. Clinical information 
      was obtained, along with computed tomography (CT)-based three-dimensional 
      geometry of the PA. Morphological measurements of the length of the main PA 
      branches, the angles between them, and the cross-sectional area of each segment 
      of the PAs were acquired using computer software. Logistic regression and 
      receiver operating characteristic curves were applied to analysis. The TOF group 
      showed a significantly smaller PA size and irregular PA shape, with lower Nakata 
      and McGoon indices, than the control group. The median bifurcation angle 
      (angle-γ) was greater than 100° in the TOF group, as compared to 66.70° in the 
      control group (P < 0.000). Residual obstruction of the infundibulum or PAs was 
      the main reason for early reoperation in this series. The development of the main 
      PA and left PA was poorer in the reoperation subset than in the non-reoperation 
      subset (P ≤ 0.01). The preoperative angle-γ in the reoperation subset was larger 
      than that in the non-reoperation subset (median, 117.8° vs. 112.0°, P = 0.026). 
      Higher weight (OR = 0.372) and McGoon index (OR = 0.122) were protective factors, 
      while larger angle-γ (> 114.8°, OR = 5.040) and angle-γ normalized by body 
      surface area (BSA) (γ/BSA > 297.9, OR = 18.860) were risk factors. This study 
      provides an intuitive perspective of PA anatomical variations in TOF. Larger 
      preoperative PA bifurcation angle and γ/BSA were morphological risk predictors of 
      postoperative reoperation in patients with TOF.

PG  - 873-882
LID - 10.1007/s12265-020-10092-7 [doi]
AB  - Non-invasive estimation of pressure gradients across a coarctation of the aorta 
      (CoA) can reduce the need for diagnostic cardiac catheterisation. We aimed to 
      validate two novel computational strategies-target-value approaching (TVA) and 
      target-value fixing (TVF)-together with unrefined Doppler estimates, and to 
      compare their diagnostic performance in identifying critical pressure drops for 
      40 patients. Compared to catheterisation, no statistically significant difference 
      was demonstrated with TVA (P = 0.086), in contrast to TVF (P = 0.005) and 
      unrefined Doppler echocardiography (P < 0.001). TVA manifested the strongest 
      correlation with catheterisation (r = 0.93), compared to TVF (r = 0.83) and 
      echocardiography (r = 0.67) (all P < 0.001). In discriminating pressure gradients 
      greater than 20 mmHg, TVA, TVF, and echocardiography had respective sensitivities 
      of 0.92, 0.88, and 0.80; specificities of 0.93, 0.80, and 0.73; and AUCs of 0.96, 
      0.89, and 0.80. The TVA strategy may serve as an effective and easily implemented 
      approach to be used in clinical management of patients with CoA. Graphical 
      Abstract Central illustration. Pressure gradients estimated using Doppler 
      echocardiography and two novel computational strategies (TVA and TVF) were 
      compared with cardiac catheterisation for 40 patients. TVA and TVF utilised the 
      CTA images to obtain the CoA anatomy and Doppler echocardiography velocimetry to 
      obtain velocity data for the assignment of CFD boundary conditions.

TI  - Psychological Effects of Heart Rate and Physical Vibration on the Operation of 
      Construction Machines: Experimental Study.
PG  - e31637
LID - 10.2196/31637 [doi]
LID - e31637
AB  - BACKGROUND: A construction method has emerged in which a camera is installed 
      around a construction machine, and the operator remotely controls the machine 
      while synchronizing the vibration of the machine with the images seen from the 
      operator's seat using virtual reality (VR) technology. Indices related to changes 
      in heart rate (HR) and physical vibration, such as heart rate variability (HRV) 
      and multiscale entropy (MSE), can then be measured among the operators. As these 
      indices are quantitative measures of autonomic regulation in the cardiovascular 
      system, they can provide a useful means of assessing operational stress. 
      OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to evaluate changes in HR and body vibration 
      of machine operators and investigate appropriate methods of machine operation 
      while considering the psychological load. METHODS: We enrolled 9 remote operators 
      (18-50 years old) in the experiment, which involved 42 measurements. A 
      construction machine was driven on a test course simulating a construction site, 
      and three patterns of operation-riding operation, remote operation using monitor 
      images, and VR operation combining monitor images and machine vibration-were 
      compared. The heartbeat, body vibration, and driving time of the participants 
      were measured using sensing wear made of a woven film-like conductive material 
      and a three-axis acceleration measurement device (WHS-2). We used HRV analysis in 
      the time and frequency domains, MSE analysis as a measure of the complexity of 
      heart rate changes, and the ISO (International Standards Organization) 2631 
      vibration index. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to model the 
      relationship among the low frequency (LF)/high frequency (HF) HRV, MSE, vibration 
      index, and driving time of construction equipment. Efficiency in driving time was 
      investigated with a focus on stress reduction. RESULTS: Multiple comparisons 
      conducted via the Bonferroni test and Kruskal-Wallis test showed statistically 
      significant differences (P=.05) in HRV-LF/HF, the vibration index, weighted 
      acceleration, motion sickness dose value (MSDV(z)), and the driving time among 
      the three operation patterns. The riding operation was found to reduce the 
      driving time of the machine, but the operation stress was the highest in this 
      case; operation based on the monitor image was found to have the lowest operation 
      stress but the longest operation time. Multiple regression analysis showed that 
      the explanatory variables (LH/HF), RR interval, and vibration index (MSDV(z) by 
      vertical oscillation at 0.5-5 Hz) had a negative effect on the driving time 
      (adjusted coefficient of determination R(2)=0.449). CONCLUSIONS: A new method was 
      developed to calculate the appropriate operating time by considering operational 
      stress and suppressing the physical vibration within an acceptable range. By 
      focusing on the relationship between psychological load and physical vibration, 
      which has not been explored in previous studies, the relationship of these 
      variables with the driving time of construction machines was clarified.

      within a Somali refugee community. DESIGN: Community-based participatory research 
      (CBPR) methods including focus group discussions, interviews, and surveys were 
      conducted with Somali community members and expert advisors to design the 
      educational content. Co-design approaches with community input were employed in a 
      phased approach to develop the VR storyline. PARTICIPANTS: 60 adult Somali 
      refugees and seven expert advisors who specialise in healthcare, autism research, 
      technology development and community engagement. SETTING: Somali refugees 
      participated at the offices of a community-based organisation, Somali Family 
      Service, in San Diego, California and online. Expert advisors responded to 
      surveys virtually. RESULTS: We find that a CBPR approach can be effectively used 
      for the co-design of a VR educational programme. Additionally, cultural and 
      linguistic sensitivities can be incorporated within a VR educational programme 
      and are essential factors for effective community engagement. Finally, effective 
      VR utilisation requires flexibility so that it can be used among community 
      members with varying levels of health and technology literacy. CONCLUSION: We 
      describe using community co-design to create a culturally and linguistically 
      sensitive VR experience promoting vaccination within a refugee community. Our 
      approach to VR development incorporated community members at each step of the 
      process. Our methodology is potentially applicable to other populations where 
      cultural sensitivities and language are common health education barriers.

TI  - The Effect of a VIrtual RealiTy Immersive Experience Upon Anxiety Levels, 
      Procedural Understanding, and Satisfaction in Patients Undergoing CArdiac 
      CaTHeterization: The VIRTUAL CATH Trial.
PG  - E681-E686
LID - JIC20210808-1 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization, we aimed to 
      evaluate the use of an immersive virtual reality (VR) experience on 
      periprocedural anxiety, procedural knowledge, and overall satisfaction, compared 
      with using generic video-based material. BACKGROUND: Cardiac catheterization is a 
      commonly performed invasive investigation for patients with cardiovascular 
      disease. Patients are understandably anxious, which can lead to negative 
      psychological and physiological outcomes. It is known that informing patients 
      adequately prior to their procedure improves the patient experience. Video-based 
      material is used frequently in this setting with proven benefits. With the 
      advancement of healthcare resources, the informed consent and explanation process 
      could be further enhanced using VR technology. METHODS: A randomized, controlled 
      trial was conducted at a single tertiary center. Patients attending the 
      preassessment clinic for elective cardiac catheterization were randomized to 
      receive either standard care, or standard care + VR. Anxiety levels, procedural 
      knowledge, and satisfaction were assessed before and after each procedure. 
      RESULTS: Sixty-four patients completed the trial (33 in the VR arm and 31 in the 
      control arm). The VR group had a significantly greater reduction in anxiety level 
      from baseline to post procedure than the control group (-5.1 vs -4.0, 
      respectively; P=.03). In addition, the VR group had a better procedural 
      understanding (3.88 vs 3.23, respectively; P<.01) and higher overall satisfaction 
      than the control group (9.35 vs 8.97, respectively; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: VR 
      improved patient-centered outcomes for cardiac catheterization. This study 
      highlights the importance of enhancing patient understanding for routine 
      procedures. VR has been shown to improve holistic care in this patient 
      population.

TI  - Multimodality cardiac imaging and new display options to broaden our 
      understanding of the tricuspid valve.
PG  - 513-524
LID - 10.1097/HCO.0000000000000890 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The prognostic impact of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and the 
      subsequent development of percutaneous procedures targeting the tricuspid valve 
      (TV), has brought to the forefront the role of imaging for the assessment of the 
      forgotten valve. As illustrated in several studies and summarized in this review, 
      currently a multimodality imaging approach is required to understand the 
      pathophysiology of TR, due to the complex TV anatomy and the close relationship 
      between the severity of TR and the extent of the remodeling of the right heart 
      chambers. RECENT FINDINGS: Recently, the advance in the tranhscatheter treatment 
      of the TV has led to a growing interest in the development of dedicated software 
      packages and new display modalities to increase our understanding of the TV. As a 
      consequence, a transversal knowledge of the different imaging modalities is 
      required for contemporary cardiac-imaging physicians. SUMMARY: This review 
      highlights the main features, and the pros and cons of echocardiography, cardiac 
      computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance and emerging technologies, as 3D 
      printing and virtual reality, in the assessment of patients with TR.

TI  - Real three-dimensional cardiac imaging using leading-edge holographic display.
PG  - 966-968
LID - 10.1002/ca.23761 [doi]
AB  - Understanding three-dimensional cardiac anatomy is fundamental for the practice 
      of clinical cardiology. However, if three-dimensional images are displayed on 
      two-dimensional monitors, they fail to provide depth perception. Currently, novel 
      technologies, including the three-dimensional printing, three-dimensional 
      monitors/projectors, and virtual reality applications can provide real 
      three-dimensionality with depth perception. However, their relatively high cost 
      and limited user-friendliness prevent their wide application. We introduce novel 
      and commercially available holographic display, which allows multiple observers 
      to see the full-color holographic images simultaneously without any specific 
      glasses and headgear. This leading-edge technology is immediately applicable in 
      both educational and clinical settings.

TI  - Assessment of single and double coronary bifurcation stenting techniques using 
      multimodal imaging and 3D modeling in reanimated swine hearts using Visible 
      Heart® methodologies.
PG  - 2591-2601
LID - 10.1007/s10554-021-02240-0 [doi]
AB  - Stent implantation in bifurcated coronary lesions is technically challenging so 
      that procedural refinements are continuously investigated. Novel procedure 
      modeling and intracoronary imaging techniques may offer critical insights on 
      stent deformations and stent-wall interactions during bifurcation stenting 
      procedures. Thus, we assessed coronary bifurcation stenting techniques using 
      multimodal imaging and 3D modeling in reanimated swine hearts. Harvested swine 
      hearts were reanimated using Visible Heart® methodologies and (under standard 
      fluoroscopic guidance) used to test 1-stent (provisional and inverted 
      provisional) and 2-stent (culotte, TAP and DK-crush) techniques on bifurcations 
      within various coronary vessels using commercially available devices. 
      Intracoronary angioscopy and frequency-domain optical-coherence-tomography (OCT) 
      were obtained during the procedures. 3D OCT reconstruction and micro-computed 
      tomography 3D modeling (post heart fixations) were used to assess stent 
      deformations and stent-wall interactions. We conducted multiple stenting 
      procedures and collected unique endoscopic and OCT images (and subsequent 
      computational models from micro-CT) to assess stent deformations and device/wall 
      interactions during different steps of bifurcation stenting procedures. 
      Endoscopy, micro-CT and virtual reality processing documented that different 1- 
      and 2-stent techniques, practiced according to experts' recommended steps, 
      achieve optimal post-intervention stent conformation. As compared with 
      intra-procedural endoscopy, software-generated 3D OCT images accurately depicted 
      stent deformations during 1-stent techniques. On the opposite, during more 
      complex 2-stent techniques, some defects were appreciated at 3D OCT 
      reconstruction despite optimal 2D OCT images. This study provided unique insights 
      regarding both stent deformations occurring in the course of bifurcation stenting 
      and the efficacy of OCT to visualize them.

TI  - Effects of Patent Ductus Arteriosus on the Hemodynamics of Modified 
      Blalock-Taussig Shunt Based on Patient-Specific Simulation.
PG  - 707128

LID - 707128
AB  - The question of preserving the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) during the modified 
      Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) procedure remains controversial. The goal of this 
      study was to investigate the effects of the PDA on the flow features of the MBTS 
      to help with preoperative surgery design and postoperative prediction. In this 
      study, a patient with pulmonary atresia and PDA was included. A patient-specific 
      three-dimensional model was reconstructed, and virtual surgeries of shunt 
      insertion and ductus ligation were performed using computer-aided design. 
      Computational fluid dynamics was utilized to analyze the hemodynamic parameters 
      of varied models based on the patient-specific anatomy and physiological data. 
      The preservation of the PDA competitively reduced the shunt flow but increased 
      total pulmonary perfusion. The shunt flow and ductal flow collided, causing 
      significant and complicated turbulence in the pulmonary artery where low wall 
      shear stress, high oscillatory shear index, and high relative residence time were 
      distributed. The highest energy loss was found when the PDA was preserved. The 
      preservation of PDA is not recommended during MBTS procedures because it 
      negatively influences hemodynamics. This may lead to pulmonary overperfusion, 
      inadequate systemic perfusion, and a heavier cardiac burden, thus increasing the 
      risk of heart failure. Also, it seems to bring no benefit in terms of reducing 
      the risk for thrombosis.

AB  - The intricate nature of congenital heart disease requires understanding of the 
      complex, patient-specific three-dimensional dynamic anatomy of the heart, from 
      imaging data such as three-dimensional echocardiography for successful outcomes 
      from surgical and interventional procedures. Conventional clinical systems use 
      flat screens, and therefore, display remains two-dimensional, which undermines 
      the full understanding of the three-dimensional dynamic data. Additionally, the 
      control of three-dimensional visualisation with two-dimensional tools is often 
      difficult, so used only by imaging specialists. In this paper, we describe a 
      virtual reality system for immersive surgery planning using dynamic 
      three-dimensional echocardiography, which enables fast prototyping for 
      visualisation such as volume rendering, multiplanar reformatting, flow 
      visualisation and advanced interaction such as three-dimensional cropping, 
      windowing, measurement, haptic feedback, automatic image orientation and 
      multiuser interactions. The available features were evaluated by imaging and 
      nonimaging clinicians, showing that the virtual reality system can help improve 
      the understanding and communication of three-dimensional echocardiography imaging 
      and potentially benefit congenital heart disease treatment.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is a common chronic disease in the medical field, which 
      has a great impact on the health of Chinese residents (especially the elderly). 
      At present, the effectiveness of the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular 
      diseases in my country is not optimistic. Overall, the prevalence and mortality 
      of CVD are still on the rise. The timely and effective detection and treatment of 
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are of great practical significance 
      to improve the health of residents and to carry out prevention and treatment. 
      This article aims to study the application of ultrasound-based virtual reality 
      technology in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases to improve 
      the efficiency and accuracy of the diagnosis of cardiovascular and 
      cerebrovascular diseases by medical staff. The focus is on the application of 
      feature attribute selection related algorithms and classification related 
      algorithms in medical and health diagnosis systems, and a cardiovascular and 
      cerebrovascular disease diagnosis system based on naive Bayes algorithm and 
      improved genetic algorithm is designed and developed. The system builds a 
      diagnostic model for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diagnoses 
      and displays the corresponding results based on the patient's examination data. 
      This paper first puts forward the theoretical concepts of ultrasonic virtual 
      reality technology, scientific computing visualization, genetic algorithm, naive 
      Bayes algorithm, and surgery simulation system and describes them in detail. 
      Then, we construct a three-dimensional ultrasonic virtual measurement system, 
      from the collection and reconstruction of image data to the filtering and 
      segmentation of image data, plus the application of three-dimensional 
      visualization and virtual reality technology to construct a three-dimensional 
      measurement system. The experimental results in this paper show that 10 isolated 
      congenital heart disease models with atrial septal defect (ASD) established 
      through the use of three-dimensional visualization and virtual reality technology 
      measured the short diameter, long diameter, and area of the atrial septal defect 
      in the left and right atria. Finally, a value of L less than 0.05 indicates that 
      the statistics are meaningful, and a value of r generally greater than 0.9 
      indicates that the virtual measurement result is highly correlated with the real 
      measurement result.

TI  - Building Embodied Spaces for Spatial Memory Neurorehabilitation with Virtual 
      Reality in Normal and Pathological Aging.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11081067 [doi]
LID - 1067
AB  - Along with deficits in spatial cognition, a decline in body-related information 
      is observed in aging and is thought to contribute to impairments in navigation, 
      memory, and space perception. According to the embodied cognition theories, 
      bodily and environmental information play a crucial role in defining cognitive 
      representations. Thanks to the possibility to involve body-related information, 
      manipulate environmental stimuli, and add multisensory cues, virtual reality is 
      one of the best candidates for spatial memory rehabilitation in aging for its 
      embodied potential. However, current virtual neurorehabilitation solutions for 
      aging and neurodegenerative diseases are in their infancy. Here, we discuss three 
      concepts that could be used to improve embodied representations of the space with 
      virtual reality. The virtual bodily representation is the combination of 
      idiothetic information involved during virtual navigation thanks to input/output 
      devices; the spatial affordances are environmental or symbolic elements used by 
      the individual to act in the virtual environment; finally, the virtual enactment 
      effect is the enhancement on spatial memory provided by actively (cognitively 
      and/or bodily) interacting with the virtual space and its elements. Theoretical 
      and empirical findings will be presented to propose innovative rehabilitative

TI  - Role of Folic Acid Drugs in the Treatment with Antithrombotic and Anticoagulant 
      Drugs for Patients with Cardiovascular Diseases Based on the Analysis of Virtual 
      Reality Medical Data.
PG  - 9914787

AB  - In recent years, with the continuous progress and development of science and 
      technology and the increasing maturity of medical technology, the incidence of 
      cardiovascular diseases has gradually increased with the age of the population. 
      In the case of cardiovascular disease, proper anticoagulant therapy can 
      effectively prevent bleeding in the occurrence of events, so a more effective 
      treatment of cardiovascular disease is considered a difficult problem to 
      overcome. Therefore, this article proposes the role of folic acid drugs based on 
      virtual reality medical data analysis in the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
      patients with antithrombotic and anticoagulant drugs, in order to improve 
      providing help for cardiovascular disease. This study selected patients with 
      cardiovascular disease who were admitted to the hospital and extracted 100 
      patients with complete data and a one-year follow-up period, covering the overall 
      status of the patients' cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease 
      degree, and the occurrence of major cardiovascular adverse events. During the 
      follow-up period, we analyzed the specific status of major cardiovascular adverse 
      events and the occurrence of bleeding events and compared and analyzed the 
      effects of folic acid drugs on the treatment with antithrombotic and 
      anticoagulant drugs in patients with cardiovascular disease. Experiments have 
      proved that the differences in the degree of cardiovascular stenosis and the 
      number of cardiovascular disease vessels in the four groups are statistically 
      significant (P < 0.01). The degree of cardiovascular stenosis in group D was 
      lighter than that in groups A, B, and C, and the number of cardiovascular lesions 
      was also less than that in groups A, B, and C. The differences were statistically 
      significant (P < 0.05). This indicates that folic acid can effectively treat 
      cardiovascular stenosis, prevent cardiovascular disease, and then treat patients 
      with cardiovascular disease with antithrombotic and anticoagulant drugs. It 
      provides an important basis for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Acute stress is often conceptualized as a response pattern that activates the 
      fight-or-flight response via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). However, other 
      stress response patterns can manifest as well, such as parasympathetic nervous 
      system (PNS) shutdown, and SNS-PNS coactive hypervigilance. Each response pattern 
      engages many dimensions, including physiological, emotional, and behavioral. As 
      stress unfolds over time, these patterns can change to adjust to the changing 
      nature of the stressor. This proof of concept study introduces novel time series 
      methodology to track the multidimensional patterns of acute stress. The defense 
      cascade provides a model with which to understand and predict response patterns 
      over the time course of an acute stressor. The time series methodology introduced 
      in this study holds promise for identifying mechanisms of change in therapy and 
      clinical settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Advances in virtual, augmented and mixed reality have led to the 
      development of wearable technologies including head mounted displays (HMD) and 
      smart glasses. While there is a growing interest on their potential applications 
      in health, only a few studies have addressed so far their use in vascular 
      surgery. The aim of this review was to summarize the fundamental notions 
      associated with these technologies and to discuss potential applications and 
      current limits for their use in vascular surgery. METHODS: A comprehensive 
      literature review was performed to introduce the fundamental concepts and provide 
      an overview of applications of HMD and smart glasses in surgery. RESULTS: HMD and 
      smart glasses demonstrated a potential interest for the education of surgeons 
      including anatomical teaching, surgical training, teaching and telementoring. 
      Applications for pre-surgical planning have been developed in general and cardiac 
      surgery and could be transposed for a use in vascular surgery. The use of 
      wearable technologies in the operating room has also been investigated in both 
      general and cardiovascular surgery and demonstrated its potential interest for 
      image-guided surgery and data collection. CONCLUSION: Studies performed so far 
      represent a proof of concept of the interest of HMD and smart glasses in vascular 
      surgery for education of surgeons and for surgical practice. Although these 
      technologies exhibited encouraging results for applications in vascular surgery, 
      technical improvements and further clinical research in large series are required 
      before hoping using them in daily clinical practice.

AB  - Depression and anxiety can significantly reduce the effectiveness of cardiac 
      rehabilitation (CR). Several studies have assessed the effectiveness of virtual 
      reality (VR)-based interventions for symptoms of anxiety and depression; however, 
      they do not relate to patients with heart disease. The aim of this study was to 
      assess the effects of VR therapy on the mental state of patients with coronary 
      artery disease (CAD). Thirty-four CAD patients with elevated anxiety or 
      depression symptoms were recruited. After randomization, 17 participants were 
      assigned to the intervention group, and 17 to the control group. Both groups 
      underwent standard CR for outpatients. In the intervention group, eight VR 
      therapy sessions were applied. In the control group, eight sessions of Schultz' 
      Autogenic Training were applied. To assess patient mental states, Hospital 
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) 
      were used, before and after 4 weeks of CR. In the intervention group, a 
      significant decrease in HADS score was observed (19.46 pretreatment vs. 15.73 
      post-treatment, p = 0.003), HADS-Anxiety subscale decreased by 16.0 percent 
      (p = 0.01) and HADS-Depression by 23.0 percent (p = 0.003). Similarly, a 
      significant decrease in PSQ was recorded at 12.8 percent (64.73 vs. 56.47, 
      p = 0.03). In the control group, HADS and PSQ data did not change. VR therapy 
      significantly reduced the severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress 
      levels in CAD patients undergoing CR. Immersive VR therapy effectively supports 
      the CR of individuals with anxiety-depressive symptoms. ClinicalTrials.gov 
      (NCT04045977).

TI  - Fetal Cardiac Services during the COVID-19 Pandemic: How Does It Affect Parental 
      Counseling?
LID - 10.3390/jcm10153423 [doi]
LID - 3423
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic impacts health care providers in multiple ways, even 
      specialties that do not seem to be affected primarily, such as fetal cardiac 
      services. We aimed to assess the effects on parental counseling for fetal 
      congenital heart disease (CHD). In this multicenter study, we used a validated 
      questionnaire. Parents were recruited from four national tertiary medical care 
      centers (n = 226); n = 169 had been counseled before and n = 57 during the 
      pandemic. Overall counseling success including its dimensions did not differ 
      between the two groups (p = n.s.). However, by applying the sorrow scale, we 
      could demonstrate that parents counseled during the pandemic were significantly 
      more concerned (p = 0.025) and unsure (p = 0.044) about their child's diagnosis, 
      therapy and outcome. Furthermore, parents expressed a significantly increased 
      need for written and/or online information on fetal heart disease (p = 0.034). 
      Other modifiers did not affect counseling success (p = n.s.). We demonstrate that 
      the COVID-19 pandemic impacts effectiveness of parental counseling for fetal CHD, 
      possibly by altering parental perceptions. This needs to be taken into 
      consideration when counseling. Implementing alternative and innovative approaches 
      (e.g., online conference or virtual reality tools) may aid in facilitating 
      high-quality services in critical times such as in the present pandemic.

TI  - The Use of Virtual Therapy in Cardiac Rehabilitation of Female Patients with 
      Heart Disease.
LID - 10.3390/medicina57080768 [doi]
LID - 768
AB  - Background and Objectives: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become increasingly 
      prevalent in women, and it is also in this group that the risk of developing 
      depression is the highest. The most commonly applied therapeutic intervention in 
      cardiac rehabilitation is Schultz's autogenic training, which has proven to be of 
      little efficacy in reducing depression and anxiety disorders. At the same time, a 
      growing number of scientific reports have been looking at the use of virtual 
      reality (VR) to treat mental health problems. This study aimed at assessing the 
      efficacy of virtual therapy in reducing levels of depression, anxiety, and stress 
      in female CVD patients. Materials and Methods: The study included 43 women who 
      were randomly divided into two groups: experimental group (N = 17), where 
      eight-week cardiac rehabilitation was enhanced with VR-based therapeutic 
      sessions, and control group (N = 26), where the VR therapy was replaced with 
      Schultz's autogenic training. Mental state parameters were measured using the 
      Perception of Stress Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
      (HADS). Results: In the experimental group, the sole parameter which failed to 
      improve was HADS-Anxiety, which remained at the baseline level. In the control 
      group, there was a deterioration in nearly all tested parameters except for 
      HADS-Depression. Statistically significant differences in the efficacy of 
      rehabilitation were recorded in relation to the level of stress in the 
      sub-scales: emotional tension (p = 0.005), external stress (p = 0.012), 
      intrapsychic stress (p = 0.023) and the generalized stress scale (p = 0.004). 
      Conclusions: VR therapy is an efficient and interesting complement to cardiac 
      rehabilitation, with proven efficacy in reducing stress levels.

AB  - 3D visualization technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality 
      (AR), and mixed reality (MR) have gained popularity in the recent decade. Digital 
      extended reality (XR) technologies have been adopted in various domains ranging 
      from entertainment to education because of their accessibility and affordability. 
      XR modalities create an immersive experience, enabling 3D visualization of the 
      content without a conventional 2D display constraint. Here, we provide a 
      perspective on XR in current biomedical applications and demonstrate case studies 
      using cell biology concepts, multiplexed proteomics images, surgical data for 
      heart operations, and cardiac 3D models. Emerging challenges associated with XR 
      technologies in the context of adverse health effects and a cost comparison of 
      distinct platforms are discussed. The presented XR platforms will be useful for 
      biomedical education, medical training, surgical guidance, and molecular data 
      visualization to enhance trainees' and students' learning, medical operation 
      accuracy, and the comprehensibility of complex biological systems.

TI  - Use of a Virtual Reality Simulator for Tendon Repair Training: Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - e27544
LID - 10.2196/27544 [doi]
LID - e27544
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) simulators have become widespread tools for 
      training medical students and residents in medical schools. Students using VR 
      simulators are provided with a 3D human model to observe the details by using 
      multiple senses and they can participate in an environment that is similar to 
      reality. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to promote a new approach 
      consisting of a shared and independent study platform for medical orthopedic 
      students, to compare traditional tendon repair training with VR simulation of 
      tendon repair, and to evaluate future applications of VR simulation in the 
      academic medical field. METHODS: In this study, 121 participants were randomly 
      allocated to VR or control groups. The participants in the VR group studied the 
      tendon repair technique via the VR simulator, while the control group followed 
      traditional tendon repair teaching methods. The final assessment for the medical 
      students involved performing tendon repair with the "Kessler tendon repair with 2 
      interrupted tendon repair knots" (KS) method and the "Bunnell tendon repair with 
      figure 8 tendon repair" (BS) method on a synthetic model. The operative 
      performance was evaluated using the global rating scale. RESULTS: Of the 121 
      participants, 117 participants finished the assessment and 4 participants were 
      lost to follow-up. The overall performance (a total score of 35) of the VR group 
      using the KS method and the BS method was significantly higher (P<.001) than that 
      of the control group. Thus, participants who received VR simulator training had a 
      significantly higher score on the global rating scale than those who received 
      traditional tendon repair training (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that 
      compared with the traditional tendon repair method, the VR simulator for learning 
      tendon suturing resulted in a significant improvement of the medical students in 
      the time in motion, flow of operation, and knowledge of the procedure. Therefore, 
      VR simulator development in the future would most likely be beneficial for 
      medical education and clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical

TI  - Heart rate variability analysis for the assessment of immersive emotional arousal 
      using virtual reality: Comparing real and virtual scenarios.
PG  - e0254098

LID - e0254098
AB  - Many affective computing studies have developed automatic emotion recognition 
      models, mostly using emotional images, audio and videos. In recent years, virtual 
      reality (VR) has been also used as a method to elicit emotions in laboratory 
      environments. However, there is still a need to analyse the validity of VR in 
      order to extrapolate the results it produces and to assess the similarities and 
      differences in physiological responses provoked by real and virtual environments. 
      We investigated the cardiovascular oscillations of 60 participants during a free 
      exploration of a real museum and its virtualisation viewed through a head-mounted 
      display. The differences between the heart rate variability features in the high 
      and low arousal stimuli conditions were analysed through statistical hypothesis 
      testing; and automatic arousal recognition models were developed across the real 
      and the virtual conditions using a support vector machine algorithm with 
      recursive feature selection. The subjects' self-assessments suggested that both 
      museums elicited low and high arousal levels. In addition, the real museum showed 
      differences in terms of cardiovascular responses, differences in vagal activity, 
      while arousal recognition reached 72.92% accuracy. However, we did not find the 
      same arousal-based autonomic nervous system change pattern during the virtual 
      museum exploration. The results showed that, while the direct virtualisation of a 
      real environment might be self-reported as evoking psychological arousal, it does 
      not necessarily evoke the same cardiovascular changes as a real arousing 
      elicitation. These contribute to the understanding of the use of VR in emotion 
      recognition research; future research is needed to study arousal and emotion 
      elicitation in immersive VR.

TI  - Virtual reality-based preprocedural education increases preparedness and 
      satisfaction of patients about the catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 690-697
LID - 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000555 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent study suggested to develop and implement more interacted 
      material for preprocedural education to decrease patients' anxiety about the 
      atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. This study compared the effectiveness of using 
      either newly developed virtual reality (VR) materials (VR group) or paper-based 
      materials (paper group) on giving AF preprocedural education. METHODS: This study 
      consequentially enrolled 33 AF patients preparing for ablation from November 2019 
      to October 2020. After enrollment, patients were randomized as either paper (n = 
      22) or VR (n = 11) groups. RESULTS: In comparison with the baseline stage, at the 
      posteducation stage, the degree of improvement in patients' self-assessed 
      self-efficacy on AF ablation knowledge was higher among VR group patients than 
      those in the paper group. At the posteducation stage, the patients' satisfaction 
      to preprocedural education and used materials were higher among the VR group than 
      that among the paper group. In addition to meet their needs and give accurate 
      medical information, VR group patients reported that VR materials increased the 
      effectiveness of education, increased their preparedness for AF catheter 
      ablation, achieved paperless purposes, and willing to recommend VR materials to 
      others. Operators subjectively reported that the periprocedure cooperation was 
      increased both among paper and VR group patients after preprocedural education 
      for the details of procedure. Better preparedness of VR group patients was 
      supported by less periprocedure pain, anxiety, and impatience than those among 
      paper group patients. CONCLUSION: Interactive VR-based materials are superior to 
      the paper-based materials to provide patients immerse and imagine the journey and 
      detail knowledge of AF catheter ablation before the procedure and better prepared 
      patients for the procedure.

AB  - 3D printing as a means of fabrication has seen increasing applications in 
      medicine in the last decade, becoming invaluable for cardiovascular applications. 
      This rapidly developing technology has had a significant impact on cardiovascular 
      research, its clinical translation and education. It has expanded our 
      understanding of the cardiovascular system resulting in better devices, tools and 
      consequently improved patient outcomes. This review discusses the latest 
      developments and future directions of generating medical replicas ('phantoms') 
      for use in the cardiovascular field, detailing the end-to-end process from 
      medical imaging to capture structures of interest, to production and use of 3D 
      printed models. We provide comparisons of available imaging modalities and 
      overview of segmentation and post-processing techniques to process images for 
      printing, detailed exploration of latest 3D printing methods and materials, and a 
      comprehensive, up-to-date review of milestone applications and their impact 
      within the cardiovascular domain across research, clinical use and education. We 
      then provide an in-depth exploration of future technologies and innovations 
      around these methods, capturing opportunities and emerging directions across 
      increasingly realistic representations, bioprinting and tissue engineering, and 
      complementary virtual and mixed reality solutions. The next generation of 3D 
      printing techniques allow patient-specific models that are increasingly 
      realistic, replicating properties, anatomy and function.

TI  - Fast-track virtual reality for cardiac imaging in congenital heart disease.
PG  - 2598-2602
LID - 10.1111/jocs.15508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: We sought to evaluate the appropriateness of 
      cardiac anatomy renderings by a new virtual reality (VR) technology, entitled 
      DIVA, directly applicable to raw magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data without 
      intermediate segmentation steps in comparison to standard three-dimensional (3D) 
      rendering techniques (3D PDF and 3D printing). Differences in post-processing 
      times were also evaluated. METHODS: We reconstructed 3D (STL, 3D-PDF, and 3D 
      printed ones) and VR models of three patients with different types of complex 
      congenital heart disease (CHD). We then asked a senior pediatric heart surgeon to 
      compare and grade the results obtained. RESULTS: All anatomical structures were 
      well visualized in both VR and 3D PDF/printed models. Ventricular-arterial 
      connections and their relationship with the great vessels were better visualized 
      with the VR model (Case 2); aortic arch anatomy and details were also better 
      visualized by the VR model (Case 3). The median post-processing time to get VR 
      models using DIVA was 5 min in comparison to 8 h (range 8-12 h including printing 
      time) for 3D models (PDF/printed). CONCLUSIONS: VR directly applied to 
      non-segmented 3D-MRI data set is a promising technique for 3D advanced modeling 
      in CHD. It is systematically more consistent and faster when compared to standard 
      3D-modeling techniques.

AB  - Advances in virtual reality have made it possible for clinicians and trainees to 
      interact with 3D renderings of hearts with congenital heart disease in 3D 
      stereoscopic vision. No study to date has assessed whether this technology 
      improved instruction compared to standard 2D interfaces. The purpose of this 
      study was to assess whether stereoscopic virtual reality improves congenital 
      heart disease anatomy education. Subjects in a prospective, blinded, randomized 
      trial completed a pre-test assessing factual and visuospatial knowledge of common 
      atrioventricular canal and were randomized to an intervention or control group 
      based on their score. The intervention group used a 3D virtual reality (VR) 
      headset to visualize a lecture with 3D heart models while the control group used 
      a desktop (DT) computer interface with the same models. Subjects took a post-test 
      and provided subjective feedback. 51 subjects were enrolled, 24 in the VR group & 
      27 in the DT group. The median score difference for VR subjects was 12 (IQR 
      9-13.3), compared to 10 (IQR 7.5-12) in the DT group. No difference in score 
      improvement was found (p = 0.11). VR subjects' impression of the ease of use of 
      their interface was higher than DT subjects (median 8 vs 7, respectively, 
      p = 0.01). VR subjects' impression of their understanding of the subject matter 
      was higher than desktop subjects (median 7 vs 5, respectively, p = 0.01). There 
      was no statistically significant difference in the knowledge acquisition observed 
      between the stereoscopic virtual reality group and the monoscopic desktop-based 
      group. Participants in virtual reality reported a better learning experience and 
      self-assessment suggesting virtual reality may increase learner engagement in 
      understanding congenital heart disease.

      Behavior Are Mediated by Cognitive Functioning: A Path Analysis.

AB  - Driving is an important skill for older adults to maintain an independent 
      lifestyle, and to preserve the quality of life. However, the ability to drive 
      safely in older adults can be compromised by age-related cognitive decline. 
      Performing an additional task during driving (e.g., adjusting the radio) 
      increases cognitive demands and thus might additionally impair driving 
      performance. Cognitive functioning has been shown to be positively related to 
      physical activity/fitness such as cardiovascular and motor coordinative fitness. 
      As such, a higher fitness level might be associated with higher cognitive 
      resources and may therefore benefit driving performance under dual-task 
      conditions. For the first time, the present study investigated whether this 
      association of physical fitness and cognitive functioning causes an indirect 
      relationship between physical fitness and dual-task driving performance through 
      cognitive functions. Data from 120 healthy older adults (age: 69.56 ± 3.62, 53 
      female) were analyzed. Participants completed tests on cardiovascular fitness 
      (cardiorespiratory capacity), motor coordinative fitness (composite score: static 
      balance, psychomotor speed, bimanual dexterity), and cognitive functions 
      (updating, inhibition, shifting, cognitive processing speed). Further, they 
      performed a virtual car driving scenario where they additionally engaged in 
      cognitively demanding tasks that were modeled after typical real-life activities 
      during driving (typing or reasoning). Structural equation modeling (path 
      analysis) was used to investigate whether cardiovascular and motor coordinative 
      fitness were indirectly associated with lane keeping (i.e., variability in 
      lateral position) and speed control (i.e., average velocity) while dual-task 
      driving via cognitive functions. Both cardiovascular and motor coordinative 
      fitness demonstrated the hypothesized indirect effects on dual-task driving. 
      Motor coordinative fitness showed a significant indirect effect on lane keeping, 
      while cardiovascular fitness demonstrated a trend-level indirect effect on speed 
      control. Moreover, both fitness domains were positively related to different 
      cognitive functions (processing speed and/or updating), and cognitive functions 
      (updating or inhibition), in turn, were related to dual-task driving. These 
      findings indicate that cognitive benefits associated with higher fitness may 
      facilitate driving performance. Given that driving with lower cognitive capacity 
      can result in serious consequences, this study emphasizes the importance for 
      older adults to engage in a physically active lifestyle as it might serve as a 
      preventive measure for driving safety.

AB  - On a global scale, cardiovascular disease has become one of the most serious 
      diseases that endangers human health and causes death and seriously threatens 
      human life and health. If we can make accurate, timely, and effective judgments 
      on cardiovascular-related parameters and take corresponding effective measures, 
      the incidence of cardiovascular diseases can be reduced to a large extent. Based 
      on this, this paper proposes the clinical application research of ultrasound 
      virtual reality technology in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular 
      diseases. This article uses literature methods, experimental research methods, 
      mathematical statistical analysis methods, and other research methods and 
      in-depth study of virtual reality technology, cardiovascular disease, and other 
      theoretical knowledge and briefly introduces ultrasound image denoising 
      algorithms, such as bilateral filtering and PM model. And on this basis, it 
      establishes clinical trials of ultrasound virtual reality technology in the 
      diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This article mainly analyzes 
      the application of virtual reality technology, technology comparison, and the 
      experimental results carried out in this article. From the survey results, the 
      total prevalence of hypertension was 25.1%, and the prevalence of males and 
      females was 25.9% and 24.4%, respectively; the diagnostic accuracy rate of the 
      experimental group reached 85.39%, while the diagnostic accuracy rate of the 
      control group was 76.8%. It shows that the use of ultrasound virtual reality 
      technology for disease diagnosis can effectively improve the accuracy of 
      cardiovascular disease diagnosis and reduce the proportion of misdiagnosis and 
      missed detection.

AB  - Simulation is a key component of training in the pediatric cardiac intensive care 
      unit (CICU), a complex environment that lends itself to virtual reality 
      (VR)-based simulations. However, VR has not been previously described for this 
      purpose. Two simulations were developed to test the use of VR in simulating 
      pediatric CICU clinical scenarios, one simulating junctional ectopic tachycardia 
      and low cardiac output syndrome, and the other simulating acute respiratory 
      failure in a patient with suspected coronavirus disease 2019. Six attending 
      pediatric cardiac critical care physicians were recruited to participate in the 
      simulations as a pilot test of VR's feasibility for educational and practice 
      improvement efforts in this highly specialized clinical environment. All 
      participants successfully navigated the VR environment and met the critical 
      endpoints of the two clinical scenarios. Qualitative feedback was overall 
      positive with some specific critiques regarding limited realism in some 
      mechanical aspects of the simulation. This is the first described use of VR in 
      pediatric cardiac critical care simulation.

TI  - Effects of ICT-Based Multicomponent Program on Body Composition and Cognitive 
      Function in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Study.
PG  - 1161-1171
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S306894 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Information and communication technology (ICT)-based training devices 
      for older adults' care related to dementia are being developed to enhance older 
      adults' cognitive functions. Older adults who require bicycle training devices 
      can improve muscle strength and balance of lower limbs by continuously 
      contracting and relaxing lower-limb muscles and improving cognitive function to 
      prevent dementia. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of an 
      ICT-based multicomponent program on body composition and cognitive function in 
      older adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a randomized controlled intervention test 
      on 20 people over the age of 60 (exercise group: n = 10; control: n = 10), the 
      multicomponent program was applied to the exercise group twice per week, once per 
      day for 12 weeks, at 30 min per session, whereas the control group was advised to 
      maintain their usual daily activities. RESULTS: Comparing body composition 
      changes and cognitive function changes before and after intervention exhibited 
      statistically significant differences in skeletal muscle mass (P=0.01) and 
      modified Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive score (P=0.01) between 
      the two groups. CONCLUSION: It can be difficult to be engaged in a simple 
      repetitive exercise program. Therefore, to meet older adults' interests and 
      expectations, a customized ICT-based multicomponent program, which can improve 
      body composition and cognitive function in older adults and is believed to help 
      prevent dementia, is recommended. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000042129

TI  - Clinical Value of Virtual Reality versus 3D Printing in Congenital Heart Disease.
LID - 10.3390/biom11060884 [doi]
LID - 884
AB  - Both three-dimensional (3D) printing and virtual reality (VR) are reported as 
      being superior to the current visualization techniques in conveying more 
      comprehensive visualization of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, little is 
      known in terms of their clinical value in diagnostic assessment, medical 
      education, and preoperative planning of CHD. This cross-sectional study aims to 
      address these by involving 35 medical practitioners to subjectively evaluate VR 
      visualization of four selected CHD cases in comparison with the corresponding 3D 
      printed heart models (3DPHM). Six questionnaires were excluded due to incomplete 
      sections, hence a total of 29 records were included for the analysis. The results 
      showed both VR and 3D printed heart models were comparable in terms of the degree 
      of realism. VR was perceived as more useful in medical education and preoperative 
      planning compared to 3D printed heart models, although there was no significant 
      difference in the ratings (p = 0.54 and 0.35, respectively). Twenty-one 
      participants (72%) indicated both the VR and 3DPHM provided additional benefits 
      compared to the conventional medical imaging visualizations. This study concludes 
      the similar clinical value of both VR and 3DPHM in CHD, although further research 
      is needed to involve more cardiac specialists for their views on the usefulness 
      of these tools.

TI  - A novel approach utilizing laser acupuncture teletherapy for management of 
      elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis: A randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 298-306
LID - 10.1177/1357633X211009861 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease is a systemic progressive 
      inflammatory autoimmune disorder. Elderly-onset RA can be assumed as a benign 
      form of RA. Until recently, face-to-face therapeutic sessions between health 
      professionals and patients are usually the method of its treatment. However, 
      during pandemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), teletherapeutic 
      sessions can extensively increase the patient safety especially in elderly 
      patients who are more vulnerable to these infections. Thus, the aim of this 
      randomized clinical trial was to evaluate a novel teletherapy approach for 
      management of elderly patients suffering from RA by utilizing laser acupuncture. 
      METHODS: A teletherapy system was used for management of elderly patients 
      suffering from RA. Sixty participants were allocated randomly into two groups and 
      the ratio was 1:1. Patients in the first group were treated with laser 
      acupuncture and telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise 
      and virtual reality training. Patients in the second group received 
      telerehabilitation sessions, which consisted of aerobic exercise and virtual 
      reality training. Evaluation of patients was done by using the Health Assessment 
      questionnaire (HAQ), the Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life (RAQoL) 
      questionnaire, and the analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum C-reactive protein 
      (CRP), plasma adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration and plasma 
      malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found 
      in CRP, RAQoL, IL-6 and MDA between the pre- and post-treatments in the first 
      group (p < 0.05) favouring the post-treatment group, while the HAQ showed a 
      statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatments (p < 0.05) 
      in both groups. Statistically significant post-treatment differences were also 
      observed between the two groups (p < 0.05) in RAQoL, CRP, ATP and MDA, favouring 
      the first group. DISCUSSION: Laser acupuncture teletherapy could be suggested as 
      a reliable treatment method for elderly patients suffering from RA, as it can 
      provide a safe and effective therapeutic approach. Teletherapy provided safer 
      access to health professionals and patients while giving a high patient 
      satisfaction value with a relatively lower cost (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 
      NCT04684693).

TI  - Modeling Tool for Rapid Virtual Planning of the Intracardiac Baffle in 
      Double-Outlet Right Ventricle.

LID - 10.1016/j.athoracsur.2021.02.058 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Biventricular repair of double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) 
      necessitates the creation of a complex intracardiac baffle. Creation of the 
      optimal baffle design and placement thereof can be challenging to conceptualize, 
      even with 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional images. This report describes a 
      recently developed methodology for creating virtual baffles to inform 
      intraoperative repair. DESCRIPTION: A total of 3 heart models of DORV were 
      created from cardiac magnetic resonance images. Baffles were created and 
      visualized using custom software. EVALUATION: This report demonstrates 
      application of the tool to virtual planning of the baffle for repair of DORV in 3 
      cases. Models were examined by a multidisciplinary team, on screen and in virtual 
      reality. Baffles could be rapidly created and revised to facilitate planning of 
      the surgical procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual modeling of the baffle pathway by 
      using cardiac magnetic resonance, creation of physical templates for the baffle, 
      and visualization in virtual reality are feasible and may be beneficial for 
      preoperative planning of complex biventricular repairs in DORV. Further work is 
      needed to demonstrate clinical benefit or improvement in outcomes.

TI  - Virtual Reality for Sedation During Atrial Fibrillation Ablation in Clinical 
      Practice: Observational Study.
PG  - e26349
LID - 10.2196/26349 [doi]
LID - e26349
AB  - BACKGROUND: Connected devices are dramatically changing many aspects in health 
      care. One such device, the virtual reality (VR) headset, has recently been shown 
      to improve analgesia in a small sample of patients undergoing transcatheter 
      aortic valve implantation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the feasibility and 
      effectiveness of VR in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation 
      under conscious sedation. METHODS: All patients who underwent an AF ablation with 
      VR from March to May 2020 were included. Patients were compared to a consecutive 
      cohort of patients who underwent AF ablation in the 3 months prior to the study. 
      Primary efficacy was assessed by using a visual analog scale, summarizing the 
      overall pain experienced during the ablation. RESULTS: The AF cryoablation 
      procedure with VR was performed for 48 patients (mean age 63.0, SD 10.9 years; 
      n=16, 33.3% females). No patient refused to use the device, although 14.6% (n=7) 
      terminated the VR session prematurely. Preparation of the VR headset took on 
      average 78 (SD 13) seconds. Compared to the control group, the mean perceived 
      pain, assessed with the visual analog scale, was lower in the VR group (3.5 [SD 
      1.5] vs 4.3 [SD 1.6]; P=.004), and comfort was higher in the VR group (7.5 [SD 
      1.6] vs 6.8 [SD 1.7]; P=.03). On the other hand, morphine consumption was not 
      different between the groups. Lastly, complications, as well as procedure and 
      fluoroscopy duration, were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      found that VR was associated with a reduction in the perception of pain in 
      patients undergoing AF ablation under conscious sedation. Our findings 
      demonstrate that VR can be easily incorporated into the standard ablation 
      workflow.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) imaging is increasingly being incorporated into a variety 
      of medical specialties: surgery and radiology being but two prominent examples. 
      Image-intensive disciplines, such as anatomic pathology (AP), represent excellent 
      potential candidates for further exploration of this innovative technology. 
      Multiple potential use cases exist within AP, involving patient care, education, 
      and research. These use cases broadly include direct utilization of the 3D 
      digital assets for viewing on a 2D screen, populating 3D extended reality 
      platforms (virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality) as well as 
      generation of 3D printed photorealistic specimen models. Herein, these use cases 
      are explored with specific regard to our experiences and yet unrealized 
      potential. Future directions and considerations are also discussed.

      Randomised Controlled Trial.

LID - 2148
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR)-enhanced 
      cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in reducing the intensity of depression and anxiety 
      symptoms in patients undergoing phase II of CR in ambulatory conditions. One 
      hundred participants (mean age 65.7 years) were divided randomly into two groups. 
      Both groups took part in eight sessions of standard CR (three times per week). 
      The experimental group was additionally supported by eight sessions of VR therapy 
      using the VR TierOne device and the control group by eight sessions of Schultz 
      Autogenic Training. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used as 
      the primary outcome measure. The Perception of Stress Questionnaire was used as 
      the secondary outcome measure. The data from 77 participants were subject to 
      analysis. Post-intervention, in the experimental group, the overall HADS score 
      was statistically significantly reduced by 13.5%, HADS-Depression by 20.8%, and 
      the general stress level by 12.8% (p < 0.05). In the control group, the scores of 
      the HADS, HADS-Anxiety and the general stress level were statistically 
      significantly higher, by 4.8%, 6.5%, and 4.9%, respectively. VR-enhanced CR for 
      individuals with cardiovascular disease reduced the level of anxiety and 
      depression symptoms compared to standard CR.

TI  - Virtual reality vs. Kalinox® for management of pain in intensive care unit after 
      cardiac surgery: a randomized study.
PG  - 74

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The management of pain and anxiety remains a challenge in the 
      intensive care unit. By distracting patients, virtual reality (VR) may have a 
      role in painful procedures. We compared VR vs. an inhaled equimolar mixture of 
      N(2)O and O(2) (Kalinox®) for pain and anxiety management during the removal of 
      chest drains after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Prospective, non-inferiority, 
      open-label study. Patients were randomized, for Kalinox® or VR session during 
      drain removal. The analgesia/nociception index (ANI) was monitored during the 
      procedure for objective assessment of pain and anxiety. The primary endpoint was 
      the ΔANI (ANI(min) - ANI(0)) during the procedure, based on ANIm (average on 4 
      min). We prespecified VR as non-inferior to Kalinox® with a margin of 3 points. 
      Self-reported pain and anxiety were also analysed using numeric rate scale (NRS). 
      RESULTS: 200 patients were included, 99 in the VR group and 101 in the Kalinox® 
      group; 90 patients were analysed in both groups in per-protocol analysis. The 
      median age was 68.0 years [60.0-74.8]. The ΔANI was - 15.1 ± 12.9 in the Kalinox® 
      group and - 15.7 ± 11.6 in the VR group (NS). The mean difference was, therefore, 
      - 0.6 [- 3.6 to 2.4], including the non-inferiority margin of 3. Patients in the 
      VR group had a significantly higher pain NRS scale immediately after the drain 
      removal, 5.0 [3.0-7.0] vs. 3.0 [2.0-6.0], p = 0.009, but no difference 10 min 
      after. NRS of anxiety did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Based on 
      the ANI, the current study showed that VR did not reach the statistical 
      requirements for a proven non-inferiority vs. Kalinox® in managing pain and 
      anxiety during chest drain removal. Moreover, VR was less effective based on NRS. 
      More studies are needed to determine if VR might have a place in the overall 
      approach to pain and anxiety in intensive care units. Trial registration NCT, 
      NCT03956264. Registered 20 May 2019,

TI  - A Randomized, Controlled, Crossover Trial of Virtual Reality in Maintenance 
      Cardiovascular Rehabilitation in a Low-Resource Setting: Impact on Adherence, 
      Motivation, and Engagement.
LID - pzab071 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ptj/pzab071 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of adding 
      virtual reality (VR) to maintenance cardiac rehabilitation (CR); it was 
      hypothesized VR would increase adherence, motivation, and engagement. METHODS: 
      This study was a randomized, 1:1 concealed-allocation, single-blinded, 
      2 parallel-arm, crossover trial. Blinded assessments were undertaken at baseline 
      (midprogram), 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after baseline. The setting was a single CR 
      program of unlimited duration in Brazil. Participants were patients with 
      cardiovascular diseases or risk factors who had been in the program for 3 months 
      or longer. The CR program consisted of 3 supervised exercise sessions per week. 
      In the VR arm, participants had 1 VR session of the 3 per week during the initial 
      12 weeks of the trial; this was withdrawn the subsequent 12 weeks. Measures were 
      program adherence (% of 3 sessions/week over 12 weeks, ascertained in all 
      participants), motivation (Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire 3), 
      and engagement (User Engagement Scale, adapted; vigor, dedication, and absorption 
      subscales); all 3 were primary outcomes. RESULTS: Sixty-one (83.6%) patients were 
      randomly assigned (n = 30 to CR + VR); 54 (88.5%) were retained at 12 and 
      24 weeks. At baseline, participants had been in CR on average 7 years and had 
      high engagement and motivation. CR + VR resulted in a significant increase in 
      adherence at 12 weeks (baseline = 72.87%; 12 weeks = 82.80%), with significant 
      reductions at 24 weeks when VR was withdrawn (65.48%); in the usual CR care arm, 
      there were no changes over time. There was a significant effect for arm, with 
      significantly higher adherence in the CR + VR arm than usual CR at 12 weeks 
      (73.51%). Motivation decreased significantly from baseline to 12 weeks (4.32 
      [SD = 0.37] vs 4.02 [SD = 0.76]) and significantly increased from 12 to 24 weeks 
      in the CR + VR arm (4.37 [SD = 0.36]). Absorption was significantly lower at 
      12 weeks in the CR + VR arm (6.79 [SD = 0.37] vs 6.20 [SD = 1.01]). CONCLUSION: 
      Although VR increased program adherence, interspersing it with usual CR sessions 
      actually decreased patient motivation and absorption. IMPACT: Supplementing a 
      maintenance CR program with VR using "exergames" resulted in significantly 
      greater adherence (8% increase or 3 of 36 sessions), and this was quite a robust 
      effect given it was extinguished with the removal of VR. However, contrary to the 
      hypotheses, offering 1 session of VR per week and 2 of usual CR exercise was 
      related to lower motivation and absorption, which has implications for how 
      clinicians design programs for this patient population.

TI  - The perspectives of mapping and monitoring of the sense of self in neurosurgical 
      patients.

AB  - Surgical treatment of tumors, epileptic foci or of vascular origin, requires a 
      detailed individual pre-surgical workup and intra-operative surveillance of brain 
      functions to minimize the risk of post-surgical neurological deficits and decline 
      of quality of life. Most attention is attributed to language, motor functions, 
      and perception. However, higher cognitive functions such as social cognition, 
      personality, and the sense of self may be affected by brain surgery. To date, the 
      precise localization and the network patterns of brain regions involved in such 
      functions are not yet fully understood, making the assessment of risks of related 
      post-surgical deficits difficult. It is in the interest of neurosurgeons to 
      understand with which neural systems related to selfhood and personality they are 
      interfering during surgery. Recent neuroscience research using virtual reality 
      and clinical observations suggest that the insular cortex, medial prefrontal 
      cortex, and temporo-parietal junction are important components of a neural system 
      dedicated to self-consciousness based on multisensory bodily processing, 
      including exteroceptive and interoceptive cues (bodily self-consciousness (BSC)). 
      Here, we argue that combined extra- and intra-operative approaches using targeted 
      cognitive testing, functional imaging and EEG, virtual reality, combined with 
      multisensory stimulations, may contribute to the assessment of the BSC and 
      related cognitive aspects. Although the usefulness of particular biomarkers, such 
      as cardiac and respiratory signals linked to virtual reality, and of heartbeat 
      evoked potentials as a surrogate marker for intactness of multisensory 
      integration for intra-operative monitoring has to be proved, systemic and 
      automatized testing of BSC in neurosurgical patients will improve future surgical 
      outcome.

TI  - Biofeedback-Based Connected Mental Health Interventions for Anxiety: Systematic 
      Literature Review.
PG  - e26038
LID - 10.2196/26038 [doi]
LID - e26038
AB  - BACKGROUND: Connected mental health, which refers to the use of technology for 
      mental health care and technology-based therapeutic solutions, has become an 
      established field of research. Biofeedback is one of the approaches used in 
      connected mental health solutions, which is mainly based on the analysis of 
      physiological indicators for the assessment and management of the psychological 
      state. Biofeedback is recommended by many therapists and has been used for 
      conditions including depression, insomnia, and anxiety. Anxiety is associated 
      with several physiological symptoms, including muscle tension and breathing 
      issues, which makes the inclusion of biofeedback useful for anxiety detection and 
      management. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify interventions using 
      biofeedback as a part of their process for anxiety management and investigate 
      their perceived effectiveness. METHODS: A systematic literature review of 
      publications presenting empirically evaluated biofeedback-based interventions for 
      anxiety was conducted. The systematic literature review was based on publications 
      retrieved from IEEE Digital Library, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. A 
      preliminary selection of papers was identified, examined, and filtered to include 
      only relevant publications. Studies in the final selection were classified and 
      analyzed to extract the modalities of use of biofeedback in the identified 
      interventions, the types of physiological data that were collected and analyzed 
      and the sensors used to collect them. Processes and outcomes of the empirical 
      evaluations were also extracted. RESULTS: After final selection, 13 publications 
      presenting different interventions were investigated. The interventions addressed 
      either primarily anxiety disorders or anxiety associated with health issues such 
      as migraine, Parkinson disease, and rheumatology. Solutions combined biofeedback 
      with other techniques including virtual reality, music therapy, games, and 
      relaxation practices and used different sensors including cardiovascular belts, 
      wrist sensors, or stretch sensors to collect physiological data such as heart 
      rate, respiration indicators, and movement information. The interventions 
      targeted different cohorts including children, students, and patients. Overall, 
      outcomes from the empirical evaluations yielded positive results and emphasized 
      the effectiveness of connected mental health solutions using biofeedback for 
      anxiety; however, certain unfavorable outcomes, such as interventions not having 
      an effect on anxiety and patients' preferring traditional therapy, were reported 
      in studies addressing patients with specific physical health issues. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The use of biofeedback in connected mental health interventions for the treatment 
      and management of anxiety allows better screening and understanding of both 
      psychological and physiological patient information, as well as of the 
      association between the two. The inclusion of biofeedback could improve the 
      outcome of interventions and boost their effectiveness; however, when used with 
      patients suffering from certain physical health issues, suitability 
      investigations are needed.

TI  - Effect of a Virtual Reality-Enhanced Exercise and Education Intervention on 
      Patient Engagement and Learning in Cardiac Rehabilitation: Randomized Controlled 
      Trial.
PG  - e23882
LID - 10.2196/23882 [doi]
LID - e23882
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is clinically proven to reduce morbidity 
      and mortality; however, many eligible patients do not enroll in treatment. 
      Furthermore, many enrolled patients do not complete their full course of 
      treatment. This is greatly influenced by socioeconomic factors but is also 
      because of patients' lack of understanding of the importance of their care and a 
      lack of motivation to maintain attendance. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore 
      the potential benefits of virtual reality (VR) walking trails within CR 
      treatment, specifically with regard to patient knowledge retention, satisfaction 
      with treatment, and the overall attendance of treatment sessions. METHODS: New CR 
      patients were enrolled and randomized on a rolling basis to either the control 
      group or intervention group. Intervention patients completed their time on the 
      treadmill with VR walking trails, which included audio-recorded education, 
      whereas control patients completed the standard of care therapy. Both groups were 
      assisted by nursing staff for all treatment sessions. Primary outcomes were 
      determined by assessing 6-minute walk test improvement. In addition, secondary 
      outcomes of patients' cardiac knowledge and satisfaction were assessed via a 
      computer-based questionnaire; patient adherence to the recommended number of 
      sessions was also monitored. Cardiac knowledge assessment included a 
      prerehabilitation education quiz, and the same quiz was repeated at patients' 
      final visit and again at the 2-month follow-up. The satisfaction questionnaire 
      was completed at the final visit. RESULTS: Between January 2018 and May 2019, 72 
      patients were enrolled-41 in the intervention group and 31 in the control group. 
      On the basis of the results of the prerehabilitation and postrehabilitation 
      6-minute walk test, no significant differences were observed between the 
      intervention and control groups (P=.64). No statistical differences were observed 
      between groups in terms of education (P=.86) or satisfaction (P=.32) at any time 
      point. The control group had statistically more favorable rates of attendance, as 
      determined by the risk group comparison (P=.02) and the comparison of the rates 
      for completing the minimum number of sessions (P=.046), but no correlation was 
      observed between the study group and reasons for ending treatment. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Although no improvements were seen in the VR intervention group over the control 
      group, it is worth noting that limitations in the study design may have 
      influenced these outcomes, not the medium itself. Furthermore, the qualitative 
      information suggests that patients may have indeed enjoyed their experience with 
      VR, even though quantitative satisfaction data did not capture this. Further 
      considerations for how and when VR should be applied to CR are suggested in this 
      paper. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03945201;

      seeks to compare carefully matched standard of care stepping activities, 
      off-the-shelf (non-custom) active video games and custom active video games that 
      are either self-paced or game-paced for promoting neuromuscular intensity and 
      accuracy, cardiovascular intensity, enjoyment and perceived effort. METHODS: 
      Fifteen persons (ages 38-72) with mild to moderate severity in the chronic phase 
      post-stroke (average 8 years) participated in a single group counter balanced 
      repeated measures study. Participants were included if they were greater than 
      6 months post-stroke, who could walk 100 feet without assistance and stand 
      unsupported for three continuous minutes. They were excluded if they had cardiac, 
      musculoskeletal or neurologic conditions that could interfere with repeated 
      stepping and follow instructions. In a single session located in a laboratory 
      setting, participants executed for 8.5 min each: repeated stepping, the 
      Kinect-light race game, two custom stepping games for the Kinect, one was 
      repeated and self-paced and the other was random and game paced. Custom video 
      games were adjusted to the participants stepping volume. Ten-minute rest periods 
      followed the exercise during which time participants rested and completed the 
      PACES an enjoyment questionnaire. Participants were instrumented with a metabolic 
      cart and heart rate sensor for collection of cardiovascular intensity (METs and % 
      of max HR) data. Stepping frequency, accuracy and pattern were acquired via 
      video. Data were analyzed using a RMANOVA and post-hoc comparison with a 
      Holm's/Sidak correction. RESULTS: Neuromuscular intensity (repetitions) was 
      significantly greater for the off-the-shelf and self-paced custom game, however 
      accuracy was greater for the custom games. Cardiovascular intensity for all 
      activities took place in the moderate intensity exercise band. Enjoyment 
      (measured with a questionnaire and rankings) was greater for the custom active 
      video games and rate of perceived exertion was lower for the custom active video 
      games. CONCLUSIONS: Custom active video games provided comparable intensity but 
      better accuracy, greater enjoyment and less perceived exertion than standard of 
      care stepping activities and a carefully matched off-the-shelf (non-custom) video 
      game. There were no differences between the game-paced and self-paced custom 
      active video games. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04538326.

AB  - Deaths due to heart diseases are a leading cause of death in Mexico. 
      Cardiovascular diseases are considered a public health problem because they 
      produce cardiorespiratory arrests. During an arrest, cardiac and/or respiratory 
      activity stops. A cardiorespiratory arrest is rapidly fatal without a quick and 
      efficient intervention. As a response to this problem, the VirtualCPR system was 
      designed in the present work. VirtualCPR is a mobile virtual reality application 
      to support learning and practicing of basic techniques of cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation (CPR) for experts or non-experts in CPR. VirtualCPR implements an 
      interactive virtual scenario with the user, which is visible by means of 
      employment of virtual reality lenses. User's interactions, with our proposal, are 
      by a portable force sensor for integration with training mannequins, whose 
      development is based on an application for the Android platform. Furthermore, 
      this proposal integrates medical knowledge in first aid, related to the basic CPR 
      for adults using only the hands, as well as technological knowledge, related to 
      development of simulations on a mobile virtual reality platform by three main 
      processes: (i) force measurement and conversion, (ii) data transmission and (iii) 
      simulation of a virtual scenario. An experiment by means of a multifactorial 
      analysis of variance was designed considering four factors for a CPR session: (i) 
      previous training in CPR, (ii) frequency of compressions, (iii) presence of 
      auditory suggestions and (iv) presence of color indicator. Our findings point out 
      that the more previous training in CPR a user of the VirtualCPR system has, the 
      greater the percentage of correct compressions obtained from a virtual CPR 
      session. Setting the rate to 100 or 150 compressions per minute, turning on or 
      off the auditory suggestions and turning the color indicator on or off during the 
      session have no significant effect on the results obtained by the user.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) is a relatively new technology that allows an individual to 
      experience a virtual world. This new immersive video type may be of particular 
      usefulness in procedure-based healthcare settings. We hypothesized that VR 
      echocardiography was non-inferior to live demonstration. Our aim was to assess 
      the usefulness of a VR echocardiographic approach in teaching echocardiography to 
      pediatric trainees compared to live demonstration. This was a single center, 
      cross-sectional observational design. We used a Garmin VIRB® 360 and a head-mount 
      display to record live echocardiography exams in a pediatric population. An 
      Oculus Go™ was used to view the 360° immersive/VR videos. Trainees responded to a 
      written questionnaire afterwards. Fifteen trainees participated in the study, 
      each of whom had previously seen echocardiography through live demonstration 
      teaching. Eleven respondents had previous hands-on echocardiography experience. 
      All 15 participants confirmed that VR echocardiography is a useful teaching tool 
      with 87% (n = 13) rating it as good or very good on a 5-point Likert scale. When 
      asked to compare VR to live demonstration, 67% (n = 10) rated VR echocardiography 
      as the same or better than live demonstration. One of the participants reported a 
      side effect, namely mild and self-resolving dizziness. VR echocardiography is a 
      safe, inexpensive and practical way for trainees to learn echocardiography. The 
      addition of VR echocardiography to the arsenal of teaching tools may enrich the 
      learning experience for trainees.

AB  - A phenomenon called White Coat Hypertension (WCH) often occurs when measuring 
      blood pressure (BP) in a real medical environment. Utilizing virtual reality (VR) 
      technology to present appropriate relaxation scenes can isolate the real medical 
      environments and may provide a new method to avoid WCH and improve the accuracy 
      of BP measurement. In this study, we designed four immersive VR relaxation scenes 
      and conducted an experiment to explore the role of VR scenes in 
      eliminating/detecting WCH in BP measurement. Results from the current sample 
      showed that both systolic BP and diastolic BP measured in the simulated medical 
      environment were significantly higher than the baseline level and the VR scene 
      condition, while there were no significant differences between the BPs measured 
      in VR scenes and the baseline level. It can be concluded that VR provides an 
      effective approach to avoid WCH in BP measurement by visually and aurally 
      isolating the real environment and assisting relaxation and provides a new 
      approach to detect the occurrence of WCH by the comparison of BPs measured in the 
      VR scene condition and real medical environments.

TI  - Stress Reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Test in Traditional and Virtual 
      Environments: A Meta-Analytic Comparison.
PG  - 200-211
LID - 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000918 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The traditional Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is a widely used 
      standardized stress induction protocol and has recently been adapted in a variety 
      of virtual reality environments (V-TSST). Research has demonstrated the ability 
      of the V-TSST to induce a stress reactivity response measured via cortisol, heart 
      rate, and self-report. However, research comparing stress reactivity induced via 
      the V-TSST to the traditional TSST across neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and 
      self-report variables has not yet been systematically and quantitatively 
      reviewed. METHODS: In this meta-analytic review, the existing studies that used 
      V-TSST were gathered, and each was age and sex matched with samples using the 
      traditional TSST. These studies were then meta-analytically synthesized to 
      determine if there was a moderating effect of TSST type (traditional TSST or 
      V-TSST) on multiple measures of stress reactivity (i.e., cortisol, heart rate, 
      and self-report). RESULTS: Examining the pre-post stress induction, the V-TSST 
      studies demonstrated comparable effect sizes (ESs) for stress reactivity 
      (cortisol ES = 0.61, heart rate ES = 0.98, self-reported stress ES = 0.94) to 
      traditional TSST study ESs (cortisol ES = 0.79, heart rate ES = 0.85, 
      self-reported stress ES = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: The TSST type differences between 
      ESs were not statistically significant, indicating that the V-TSST is as 
      effective as the traditional TSST at eliciting a physiological and self-reported 
      stress reactivity response. Implications and limitations of this meta-analysis 
      are discussed, and recommendations for future research are provided.

AB  - As part of the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 
      cardiothoracic training programs quickly transitioned midinterview season toward 
      a virtual format. This monumental and rapid undertaking led to the adoption of 
      novel virtual interviewing techniques, many of which have been developed and 
      partially rolled out by other specialties for years. The COVID-19 pandemic is 
      still here, and when the end will be in sight is unclear. However, most, if not 
      all, of the novel interview techniques that were rapidly adopted by 
      cardiothoracic training programs during the 2020 interview season will continue 
      to be relevant even after the pandemic and need for social distancing subsides. 
      In this literature review, we highlight techniques that can be used by 
      cardiothoracic training programs to virtually showcase their attributes and 
      strengths to give applicants as realistic of a view of the program as possible. 
      Such efforts include developing and emphasizing a social media presence, 
      expanding information within training program websites, broadcasting virtual 
      educational content, and creating virtual tours. In addition, we will review 
      approaches toward structuring a virtual interview day to provide candidates with 
      a deeper glimpse into the inner workings of the program. We can use this 
      opportunity provided by the COVID-19 pandemic to develop innovative methods of 
      conducting fellowship interviews that may persist long into the future, as we 
      consider limitations historically caused by finances, scheduling, clinical 
      responsibilities, and family needs.

AB  - The space around the body crucially serves a variety of functions, first and 
      foremost, preserving one's own safety and avoiding injury. Recent research has 
      shown that emotional information, in particular threatening facial expressions, 
      affects the regulation of peripersonal-reaching space (PPS, for action with 
      objects) and interpersonal-comfort space (IPS, for social interaction). Here we 
      explored if emotional facial expressions may similarly or differently affect both 
      spaces in terms of psychophysiological reactions (cardiac inter-beat intervals: 
      IBIs, i.e. inverse of heart rate; Skin Conductance Response amplitude: SCR 
      amplitude) and spatial distance. Through Immersive Virtual Reality technology, 
      participants determined reaching-distance (PPS) and comfort-distance (IPS) from 
      virtual confederates exhibiting happy/angry/neutral facial expressions while 
      being approached by them. During these interactions, spatial distance and 
      psychophysiological reactions were recorded. Results revealed that when 
      interacting with angry virtual confederates the distance increased similarly in 
      both comfort-social and reaching-action spaces. Moreover, interacting with 
      virtual confederates exhibiting angry rather than happy or neutral expressions 
      provoked similar psychophysiological activations (SCR amplitude, IBIs) in both 
      spaces. Regression analyses showed that psychophysiological activations, 
      particularly SCR amplitude in response to virtual confederates approaching with 
      angry expressions, were able to predict the increase of PPS and IPS. These 
      findings suggest that self-protection functions could be the expression of a 
      common defensive mechanism shared by social and action spaces.

AB  - The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is a reliable social-evaluative stressor. To 
      overcome limitations of the in vivo TSST, a standardized virtual reality TSST 
      (VR-TSST) was developed. The present study compares the emotional (anxiety) and 
      physiological (heart period and variability) response to a VR-TSST with an in 
      vivo TSST and a control condition. Participants took part in either an in vivo 
      TSST (N = 106, 64% female), VR-TSST (N = 52, 100% female), or a control TSST 
      (N = 20, 40% female). Mixed linear modeling examined response profile differences 
      related to TSST type. While there was an equivalent anxiety response to the in 
      vivo TSST as the VR-TSST, we found a smaller heart period and heart rate 
      variability response in VR-TSST compared to the in vivo TSST, especially in 
      response to the math part of the test. The present findings demonstrate that 
      social evaluative stress can be successfully induced in a VR setting, producing 
      similar emotional and slightly attenuated cardiovascular responses.

AB  - Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) programs, focused on improving the health trajectory 
      of patients with cardiovascular disease, strive to increase physical activity 
      (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness. However, historically low compliance with 
      recommended PA has prompted exploration of alternatives to traditional courses of 
      exercise therapy. One alternative, exergaming, or the requirement of physical 
      exercise inherent to a video game's activities, has shown to have a promising 
      impact in improving patient self-efficacy for exercise training using digital 
      hardware (eg, the Wii or the Xbox Kinect). Furthermore, novel technologies in 
      virtual reality can provide an engaging, immersive environment for exergaming 
      techniques, maximizing goal-oriented training and building self-efficacy for 
      patients during CR. Many groundbreaking institutions are already calculating 
      energy expenditure of commercially successful virtual reality games and finding 
      promise in the cardiometabolic responses to a number of virtual reality games. 
      Research is still limited in establishing the efficacy of these games, but 
      virtual reality and exergaming are quickly proving to be appropriate and 
      equivalent alternatives to traditional exercise programs. Though studies have 
      examined the impact of prescriptive exergaming on PA, they have yet to examine 
      the potential for genuine integration of game-based motivational techniques and 
      immersive environments into clinical interaction. The purpose of this review is 
      to describe the current body of evidence and the impact and future potential of 
      virtual reality and exergaming. Further, we will introduce the concept of a 
      "Clinical Arcade" as a new approach to integration of these techniques in CR 
      care.

TI  - Virtual Reality Assisted Cardiac Catheterization.
LID - 115982D [pii]
LID - 10.1117/12.2582097 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac catheterization is a delicate strategy often used during various heart 
      procedures. However, the procedure carries a myriad of risks associated with it, 
      including damage to the vessel or heart itself, blood clots, and arrhythmias. 
      Many of these risks increase in probability as the length of the operation 
      increases, creating a demand for a more accurate procedure while reducing the 
      overall time required. To this end, we developed an adaptable virtual reality 
      simulation and visualization method to provide essential information to the 
      physician ahead of time with the goal of reducing potential risks, decreasing 
      operation time, and improving the accuracy of cardiac catheterization procedures. 
      We additionally conducted a phantom study to evaluate the impact of using our 
      virtual reality system prior to a procedure.

TI  - Use of Virtual Reality to Educate Undergraduate Medical Students on Cardiac 
      Peripheral and Collateral Circulation.
PG  - 19-22
LID - 10.1007/s40670-020-01104-x [doi]
AB  - Many medical schools are looking to utilize virtual reality (VR); however, due to 
      its novelty, we know little about how VR can be effectively used in medical 
      education. This study evaluates a case-centered VR task that supported students 
      with learning peripheral and collateral circulation, anatomical features that are 
      not easily observed in cadavers. Data sources included a quiz, survey, and focus 
      group. Based on quantitative and qualitative analyses, we support the claim that 
      this activity was an effective use of VR and identify features that made it 
      effective, which can guide other educators who are interested in developing VR 
      activities.

TI  - Developing a virtual reality simulation system for preoperative planning of 
      thoracoscopic thoracic surgery.
PG  - 778-783
LID - 10.21037/jtd-20-2197 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has become a standard 
      approach for the treatment of lung cancer. However, its minimally invasive nature 
      limits the field of view and reduces tactile feedback. These limitations make it 
      vital that surgeons thoroughly familiarize themselves with the patient's anatomy 
      preoperatively. We have developed a virtual reality (VR) surgical navigation 
      system using head-mounted displays (HMD). The aim of this study was to 
      investigate the potential utility of this VR simulation system in both 
      preoperative planning and intraoperative assistance, including support during 
      thoracoscopic sublobar resection. METHODS: Three-dimensional (3D) polygon data 
      derived from preoperative computed tomography data was loaded into BananaVision 
      software developed at Colorado State University and displayed on an HMD. An 
      interactive 3D reconstruction image was created, in which all the pulmonary 
      structures could be individually imaged. Preoperative resection simulations were 
      performed with patient-individualized reconstructed 3D images. RESULTS: The 3D 
      anatomic structure of pulmonary vessels and a clear vision into the space between 
      the lesion and adjacent tissues were successfully appreciated during preoperative 
      simulation. Surgeons could easily evaluate the real patient's anatomy in 
      preoperative simulations to improve the accuracy and safety of actual surgery. 
      The VR software and HMD allowed surgeons to visualize and interact with real 
      patient data in true 3D providing a unique perspective. CONCLUSIONS: This initial 
      experience suggests that a VR simulation with HMD facilitated preoperative 
      simulation. Routine imaging modalities combined with VR systems could 
      substantially improve preoperative planning and contribute to the safety and 
      accuracy of anatomic resection.

LID - e019321
AB  - Background Social media is an effective channel for the advancement of women 
      physicians; however, its use by women in cardiology has not been systematically 
      studied. Our study seeks to characterize the current Women in Cardiology Twitter 
      network. Methods and Results Six women-specific cardiology Twitter hashtags were 
      analyzed: #ACCWIC (American College of Cardiology Women in Cardiology), #AHAWIC 
      (American Heart Association Women in Cardiology), #ilooklikeacardiologist, 
      #SCAIWIN (Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Women in 
      Innovations), #WomeninCardiology, and #WomeninEP (Women in Electrophysiology). 
      Twitter data from 2016 to 2019 were obtained from Symplur Signals. Quantitative 
      and descriptive content analyses were performed. The Women in Cardiology Twitter 
      network generated 48 236 tweets, 266 180 903 impressions, and 12 485 users. 
      Tweets increased by 706% (from 2083 to 16 780), impressions by 207% (from 
      26 755 476 to 82 080 472), and users by 440% (from 796 to 4300), including a 471% 
      user increase internationally. The network generated 6530 (13%) original tweets 
      and 43 103 (86%) amplification tweets. Most original and amplification tweets 
      were authored by women (81% and 62%, respectively) and women physicians (76% and 
      52%, respectively), with an increase in original and amplification tweets 
      authored by academic women physicians (98% and 109%, respectively) and trainees 
      (390% and 249%, respectively) over time. Community building, professional 
      development, and gender advocacy were the most common tweet contents over the 
      study period. Community building was the most common tweet category for #ACCWIC, 
      #AHAWIC, #ilooklikeacardiologist, #SCAIWIN, and #WomeninCardiology, whereas 
      professional development was most common for #WomeninEP. Conclusions The Women in 
      Cardiology Twitter network has grown immensely from 2016 to 2019, with women 
      physicians as the driving contributors. This network has become an important 
      channel for community building, professional development, and gender advocacy 
      discussions in an effort to advance women in cardiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Single-stage unifocalisation for pulmonary atresia (PA) with 
      ventricular septal defect (VSD) and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries 
      (MAPCA) requires a high degree of three-dimensional (3D) anatomical imagination. 
      A previous study has reported the application of a 3D-printed heart model with 
      virtual reality (VR) or mixed reality (MR). However, few studies have evaluated 
      the surgical outcomes of the 3D model with VR or MR in PA/VSD patients. METHODS: 
      Three-dimensional (3D) heart models of five selected PA/VSD patients were derived 
      from traditional imageology of their hearts. Using VR glasses, the 3D models were 
      also visualised in the operating room. Both the 3D-printed heart models and 
      preoperative evaluation by VR were used in the five selected patients for 
      surgical simulation and better anatomical understanding. Mixed reality holograms 
      were used as perioperative assistive tools. Surgical outcomes were assessed, 
      including in-hospital and early follow-up clinical data. RESULTS: The use of 
      these three new technologies had favourable feedback from the surgeons on 
      intraoperative judgment. There were no in-hospital or early deaths. No 
      reintervention was required until the last follow-up. Three (3) patients 
      developed postoperative complications: one had right bundle branch block and 
      ST-segment change, one had chest drainage >7 days (>40 mL/day) and one had 
      pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The preoperative application of a 3D-printed heart model 
      with VR or MR helped in aligning the surgical field. These technologies improved 
      the understanding of complicated cardiac anatomy and achieved acceptable surgical 
      outcomes as guiding surgical planning.

TI  - Ready Exerciser One: Effects of music and virtual reality on cycle ergometer 
      exercise.
PG  - 15-32
LID - 10.1111/bjhp.12445 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Physical inactivity remains a major global health concern, and 
      researchers have been encouraged to explore the role of technology in the 
      promotion of physical activity. Technologies that deliver audio-visual stimuli 
      are frequently applied in the exercise domain. However, there is a paucity of 
      research that examines the efficacy of modern virtual reality (VR) technology in 
      this context. We investigated the effects of VR and music on affective, 
      perceptual, enjoyment, and cardiac responses to aerobic-type exercise. DESIGN: A 
      fully counterbalanced, within-subjects design was employed. METHODS: A 
      convenience sample of recreationally active adult volunteers (N = 24) completed a 
      12-min protocol during which they exercised under music, VR, VR-with-music, and 
      control conditions. RESULTS: Analyses indicated a Condition × Time interaction 
      for affective valence and perceived activation. Moreover, a main effect of 
      condition emerged for state attention and perceived enjoyment. The VR and 
      VR-with-music conditions elicited the most positive affective valence, highest 
      levels of perceived activation, greatest number of dissociative thoughts, and 
      most exercise enjoyment. Differences between these two conditions were negligible 
      across the breadth of dependent variables. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings 
      illustrate the efficacy of modern VR technology in the exercise context, applied 
      both with and without musical accompaniment. Additional research is required to 
      assess the degree to which the findings are replicable among sedentary or ageing 
      segments of the population. Given the emerging support pertaining to a positive 
      relationship between affective responses and exercise adherence, VR technology 
      should be considered as a means by which to promote an enjoyable exercise 
      experience.

      review.
PG  - 448-457
LID - 10.1080/09638288.2019.1631892 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To carry out a systematic review about the information about the 
      application of of virtual reality and videogames in cardiac rehabilitation. 
      METHODS: A systematic review was conducted. Jadad scale was applied to evaluate 
      the methodological quality of the articles included and the degree of evidence 
      and the level of recommendation were determined through the Oxford Center for 
      Evidence-Based Medicine. PRISMA guidelines statement for systematic reviews were 
      followed. RESULTS: The total number of articles included in the present review 
      was 10, with heterogeneity in the study populations, cardiac rehabilitation 
      phases, technology used and protocols. Most of the studies showed an increase in 
      heart rate, less pain, a greater ability to walk, higher energy levels, an 
      increase in physical activity and improvements of motivation and adherence. The 
      methodological quality of the studies was between acceptable and poor. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of virtual reality and videogames could be considered as 
      complementary tools of physical training in patients with cardiovascular diseases 
      in the different phases of cardiac rehabilitation. However, it is also necessary 
      to carry out studies with adequate methodological quality to determine the ideal 
      technological systems, target populations and clearly protocols to study their 
      effects in the short, medium and long-term assessments.Implications for 
      rehabilitationThe use of virtual reality and videogames could be considered as 
      complementary tools for physical training in patients with cardiovascular 
      diseases.Interactive virtual reality using exergames may promote heart rate, 
      fatigue perception, physical activity and reduce pain in patients with 
      cardiovascular diseases.Virtual reality and videogames enhance motivation and 
      adherence in cardiac rehabilitation programs.

TI  - Optimal Combination of Chest Compression Depth and Rate in Virtual Reality 
      Resuscitation Training: A Post Hoc Analysis of the Randomized Lowlands Saves 
      Lives Trial.

AB  - Background Dissemination of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills is 
      essential for cardiac arrest survival. Virtual reality (VR)-training methods are 
      low cost and easily available, but to meet depth requirements adaptations are 
      required, as confirmed in a recent randomized study on currently prevailing CPR 
      quality criteria. Recently, the promising clinical performance of new CPR quality 
      criteria was demonstrated, based on the optimal combination of compression depth 
      and rate. We now study compliance with these newly proposed CPR quality criteria. 
      Methods and Results Post hoc analysis of a randomized trial compared standardized 
      20-minute face-to-face CPR training with VR training using the Lifesaver VR 
      smartphone application. During a posttraining test, compression depth and rate 
      were measured using CPR mannequins. We assessed compliance with the newly 
      proposed CPR criteria, that is, compression rate within ±20% of 107/minute and 
      depth within ±20% of 47 mm. We studied 352 participants, age 26 (22-31) years, 
      56% female, and 15% with CPR training ≤2 years. Among VR-trained participants, 
      there was a statistically significant difference between the proportions 
      complying with newly proposed versus the currently prevailing quality criteria 
      (52% versus 23%, P<0.001). The difference in proportions complying with rate 
      requirements was statistically significant (96% for the new versus 50% for 
      current criteria, P<0.001), whereas there was no significant difference with 
      regard to the depth requirements (55% versus 51%, P=0.45). Conclusions Lifesaver 
      VR training, although previously found to be inferior to face-to-face training, 
      may lead to CPR quality compliant with recently proposed, new quality criteria. 
      If the prognostic importance of these new criteria is confirmed in additional 
      studies, Lifesaver VR in its current form would be an easily available vector to 
      disseminate CPR skills.

AB  - Background: Dementia is one the major problems of aging societies, and, novel and 
      effective non-drug therapies are required as interventions in the oldest-old to 
      prevent cognitive decline. Objective: This study aims to examine the efficacy and 
      safety of reminiscence using immersive virtual reality (iVR reminiscence) 
      focusing on anxiety that often appears with cognitive decline. The secondary 
      objective is to reveal the preference for VR image types for reminiscence: 
      live-action (LA) or computer graphics (CG). Methods: This was a pilot, 
      open-label, and randomized crossover study which was conducted on January 2020 at 
      a single nursing home. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups (A or 
      B) in equal numbers, and they alternately viewed two types of VR images (LA and 
      CG) themed on the mid- to late Showa era (A.D. 1955-1980) in Japan. In group A, 
      the CG images were viewed first, and then the LA images were viewed (CG→ LA). In 
      group B, the images were viewed in the opposite order (LA→ CG). Before VR 
      viewing, subjects responded to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Japanese 
      version and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Japanese version. After viewing 
      the first and second VR, subjects responded to STAI and the numerical rating 
      scale (NRS) for satisfaction and side effects (nausea, dizziness, headache, and 
      tiredness). Results: Ten subjects participated in this study. The values of 
      analyses are presented in the mean (SD). The age was 87.1 years (4.2), and the 
      MMSE was 28.5 (1.8). The total STAI score before VR viewing was 36.1 (7.2), but 
      it significantly decreased to 26.8 (4.9) after the first VR viewing (P = 0.0010), 
      and further decreased to 23.4 (2.8) after the second VR viewing (P < 0.001). The 
      NRS score for satisfaction tended to be higher after viewing LA in group A (CG→ 
      LA) (CG vs. LA; 7.0 (2.3) vs. 8.6 (1.5), P = 0.0993), while in group B (LA→ CG), 
      the score after CG was slightly lower than that after LA. There were no serious 
      side effects. Conclusions: This study suggests that iVR reminiscence can reduce 
      anxiety in the oldest-old without causing serious side effects. Furthermore, the 
      impacts might be better with LA images.

TI  - Remote Reminiscence Using Immersive Virtual Reality May Be Efficacious for 
      Reducing Anxiety in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment Even in COVID-19 
      Pandemic: A Case Report.
PG  - 1019-1023
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b21-00052 [doi]
AB  - To prevent cognitive decline, non-pharmacological therapies such as reminiscence 
      for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are required, however, the use of nursing 
      homes was limited due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, the 
      demand for remote-care is increasing. We hypothesized that immersive virtual 
      reality (iVR) could be used more effectively than conventional reminiscence for 
      anxiety. We first examined the effectiveness and safety of reminiscence using iVR 
      (iVR reminiscence session) in patients with MCI. After COVID-19 imposed 
      restriction on visiting nursing homes, we conducted online iVR reminiscence 
      session (remote iVR reminiscence session) and compared its effectiveness with 
      that of interpersonal iVR reminiscence session (face-to-face iVR reminiscence 
      session). The results of two elderly with MCI suggested that iVR reminiscence 
      could reduce anxiety and the burden of care without serious side effects. The 
      effects of remote iVR reminiscence might be almost as effective as those of 
      face-to-face one.

TI  - Directional effects of whole-body spinning and visual flow in virtual reality on 
      vagal neuromodulation.
PG  - 479-494
LID - 10.3233/VES-201574 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neural circuits allow whole-body yaw rotation to modulate vagal 
      parasympathetic activity, which alters beat-to-beat variation in heart rate. The 
      overall output of spinning direction, as well as vestibular-visual interactions 
      on vagal activity still needs to be investigated. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      investigated direction-dependent effects of visual and natural vestibular 
      stimulation on two autonomic responses: heart rate variability (HRV) and pupil 
      diameter. METHODS: Healthy human male subjects (n = 27) underwent constant 
      whole-body yaw rotation with eyes open and closed in the clockwise (CW) and 
      anticlockwise (ACW) directions, at 90°/s for two minutes. Subjects also viewed 
      the same spinning environments on video in a VR headset. RESULTS: CW spinning 
      significantly decreased parasympathetic vagal activity in all conditions (CW open 
      p = 0.0048, CW closed p = 0.0151, CW VR p = 0.0019,), but not ACW spinning (ACW 
      open p = 0.2068, ACW closed p = 0.7755, ACW VR p = 0.1775,) as indicated by an 
      HRV metric, the root mean square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD). 
      There were no direction-dependent effects of constant spinning on sympathetic 
      activity inferred through the HRV metrics, stress index (SI), sympathetic nervous 
      system index (SNS index) and pupil diameter. Neuroplasticity in the CW eyes 
      closed and CW VR conditions post stimulation was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Only one 
      direction of yaw spinning, and visual flow caused vagal nerve neuromodulation and 
      neuroplasticity, resulting in an inhibition of parasympathetic activity on the 
      heart, to the same extent in either vestibular or visual stimulation. These 
      results indicate that visual flow in VR can be used as a non-electrical method 
      for vagus nerve inhibition without the need for body motion in the treatment of 
      disorders with vagal overactivity. The findings are also important for VR and 
      spinning chair based autonomic nervous system modulation protocols, and the 
      effects of motion integrated VR.

AB  - Modern technologies are often utilised in schools or universities with a variety 
      of educational goals in mind. Of particular interest is the enhanced 
      interactivity and engagement offered by mixed reality devices such as the 
      HoloLens, as well as the ability to explore anatomical models of disease using 
      augmented and virtual realities. As the students are required to learn an 
      ever-increasing number of diseases within a university health science or 
      medical degree, it is crucial to consider which technologies provide value to 
      educators and students. This chapter explores the opportunities for using modern 
      disruptive technologies to teach a curriculum surrounding disease. For relevant 
      examples, a focus will be placed on asthma as a respiratory disease which is 
      increasing in prevalence, and stroke as a neurological and cardiovascular 
      disease. The complexities of creating effective educational curricula around 
      these diseases will be explored, along with the benefits of using augmented 
      reality and mixed reality as viable teaching technologies in a range of use 
      cases.

TI  - Review of Digitalized Patient Education in Cardiology: A Future Ahead?
PG  - 263-271
LID - 10.1159/000512778 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: An increased focus on shared decision-making and patient 
      empowerment in cardiology and on patient outcomes such as quality of life (QoL), 
      depression, and anxiety underline the importance of high-quality patient 
      education. Studies focusing on digital means of patient education performed in 
      other disciplines of medicine demonstrated its positive effect in these areas. 
      Therefore, a review of the current literature was performed to (i) evaluate the 
      status of innovative, digitalized means of patient education in cardiology and 
      (ii) assess the impact of digital patient education on outcome parameters (i.e., 
      patient knowledge (or health literacy), QoL, depression, anxiety, and patient 
      satisfaction). METHOD: A review of the current literature was performed to 
      evaluate the effect of digitalized patient education for any purpose in the field 
      of cardiology. Medline and EMBASE were searched for articles reporting any 
      digital educational platform used for patient education up to May 2020. The 
      articles were compared on their effect on patient knowledge or health literacy, 
      QoL, depression or anxiety, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: The initial search 
      yielded 279 articles, 34 of which were retained after applying in, and exclusion 
      criteria. After full-text analysis, the total number of articles remaining was 
      16. Of these, 6 articles discussed the use of smartphone or tablet applications 
      as a means of patient education, whereas 3 reviewed web-based content, and 7 
      evaluated the use of video (2 three-dimensional videos, from which one on a 
      virtual reality headset). CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates that digital 
      patient education increases patient knowledge. Overall, digital education 
      increases QoL and lowers feelings of depression and anxiety. The majority of 
      patients express satisfaction with digital platforms. It remains important that 
      developers of digital patient education platforms remain focused on clear, 
      structured, and comprehensible information presentation.

AB  - In our healthcare system, mindful of patient safety and the reduction of medical 
      errors, simulation-based training has emerged as the cornerstone of medical 
      education, allowing quality training in complete safety for patients. Initiated 
      by anaesthesiologists, this teaching mode effectively allows a gradual transfer 
      of learning, and has become an essential tool in cardiology teaching. 
      Cardiologists are embracing simulation to master complex techniques in 
      interventional cardiology, to manage crisis situations and unusual complications 
      and to develop medical teamwork. Simulation methods in cardiology include 
      high-fidelity simulators, clinical scenarios, serious games, hybrid simulation 
      and virtual reality. Simulation involves all fields of cardiology: 
      transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty 
      and electrophysiology. Beyond purely technical issues, simulation can also 
      enhance communication skills, by using standardized patients, and can improve the 
      management of situations related to the announcement of serious diseases. In this 
      review of recent literature, we present existing simulation modalities, their 
      applications in different fields of cardiology and their advantages and 
      limitations. Finally, we detail the growing role for simulation in the teaching 
      of medical students following the recent legal obligation to use simulation to 
      evaluate medical students in France.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the successful application 
      of virtual reality to improve physical therapy in the pediatric cardiovascular 
      intensive care unit. Early mobilization and cognitive stimulation improve 
      morbidity of critically ill children. However, maintaining child engagement with 
      these therapies can be challenging, especially during extended intensive care 
      stays. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: While virtual reality has been successfully used as 
      an analgesic and anxiolytic in the cardiovascular intensive care unit, this 
      report demonstrates its novel use as a tool to augment physical therapy for a 
      child who had been debilitated after heart transplantation. Virtual reality 
      encouraged the child to engage in physical therapy sessions, participate for 
      greater durations, and directly address barriers to discharge. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: While further studies are needed to define 
      best practice, this report demonstrates that virtual reality can be safely used 
      for carefully selected and monitored children in critical care.

TI  - Virtual reality informative aids increase residents' atrial fibrillation ablation 
      procedures-related knowledge and patients' satisfaction.
PG  - 25-32
LID - 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000464 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and 
      increasing numbers of patients receive AF ablation nowadays. Therefore, in the 
      cardiology division, residents need to be familiar with the AF ablation 
      procedure-related knowledge for primary care. This study evaluated the baseline 
      residents and patients' self-efficacy to the AF ablation procedure-related 
      knowledge, developed the specific virtual reality (VR) informative aids, and 
      evaluated the effects of VR training and resident-led VR aids-based patient 
      education on their self-efficacy, in the aspects of familiarity, confidence and 
      anxiety, and satisfaction. METHODS: From 2019, April to 2020, April, this 1-year 
      prospective prestudy and poststudy was undergone in the cardiology division. 
      Between 2019, April and 2019, December, the experienced physicians were invited 
      to develop VR informative aids for AF ablation procedure-related knowledge. 
      Between January 2020 and April 2020, newly developed VR informative aids were 
      implemented in the educational program of training rotated residents for giving 
      patient education. RESULT: A total of 20 residents and 32 patients were enrolled. 
      The baseline self-reported self-efficacy and knowledge scores were relatively low 
      among rotated residents and their patients. In addition to the high level of 
      satisfaction, self-efficacy and knowledge scores of residents and their patients 
      were increased after VR aids-based training and resident-led patient education. 
      Higher degree of improvement in self-efficacy was noted among patients with 
      depression/anxiety history than those without history. The follow-up assessments 
      among residents showed that the positive effects of VR aids were sustained until 
      2 weeks later. CONCLUSION: Overall, residents and patients reported that the VR 
      aids increase the effectiveness of patient education, achieve the purpose of a 
      paperless environment, and motivate them to recommend it to others. The 
      implementation of resident-to-patient education has a positive impact on trainees 
      and patients understanding about AF ablation procedures-related knowledge.

TI  - Egocentric and Allocentric Spatial Memory in Mild Cognitive Impairment with 
      Real-World and Virtual Navigation Tasks: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 95-116
LID - 10.3233/JAD-201017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spatial navigation is the ability to estimate one's position on the 
      basis of environmental and self-motion cues. Spatial memory is the cognitive 
      substrate underlying navigation and relies on two different reference frames: 
      egocentric and allocentric. These spatial frames are prone to decline with aging 
      and impairment is even more pronounced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) or in mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI). OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of 
      experimental studies investigating which MCI population and tasks are used to 
      evaluate spatial memory and how allocentric and egocentric deficits are impaired 
      in MCI after navigation. METHODS: PRISMA and PICO guidelines were applied to 
      carry out the systematic search. Down and Black checklist was used to assess 
      methodological quality. RESULTS: Our results showed that amnestic MCI and AD 
      pathology are the most investigated typologies; both egocentric and allocentric 
      memory are impaired in MCI individuals, and MCI due to AD biomarkers has specific 
      encoding and retrieval impairments; secondly, spatial navigation is principally 
      investigated with the hidden goal task (virtual and real-world version), and 
      among studies involving virtual reality, the privileged setting consists of 
      non-immersive technology; thirdly, despite subtle differences, real-world and 
      virtual versions showed good overlap for the assessment of MCI spatial memory. 
      CONCLUSION: Considering that MCI is a subclinical entity with potential risk for 
      conversion to dementia, investigating spatial memory deficits with navigation 
      tasks might be crucial to make accurate diagnosis and rehabilitation.

TI  - A global benchmark of algorithms for segmenting the left atrium from late 
      gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

AB  - Segmentation of medical images, particularly late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic 
      resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) used for visualizing diseased atrial structures, is a 
      crucial first step for ablation treatment of atrial fibrillation. However, direct 
      segmentation of LGE-MRIs is challenging due to the varying intensities caused by 
      contrast agents. Since most clinical studies have relied on manual, 
      labor-intensive approaches, automatic methods are of high interest, particularly 
      optimized machine learning approaches. To address this, we organized the 2018 
      Left Atrium Segmentation Challenge using 154 3D LGE-MRIs, currently the world's 
      largest atrial LGE-MRI dataset, and associated labels of the left atrium 
      segmented by three medical experts, ultimately attracting the participation of 27 
      international teams. In this paper, extensive analysis of the submitted 
      algorithms using technical and biological metrics was performed by undergoing 
      subgroup analysis and conducting hyper-parameter analysis, offering an overall 
      picture of the major design choices of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and 
      practical considerations for achieving state-of-the-art left atrium segmentation. 
      Results show that the top method achieved a Dice score of 93.2% and a mean 
      surface to surface distance of 0.7 mm, significantly outperforming prior 
      state-of-the-art. Particularly, our analysis demonstrated that double 
      sequentially used CNNs, in which a first CNN is used for automatic 
      region-of-interest localization and a subsequent CNN is used for refined regional 
      segmentation, achieved superior results than traditional methods and machine 
      learning approaches containing single CNNs. This large-scale benchmarking study 
      makes a significant step towards much-improved segmentation methods for atrial 
      LGE-MRIs, and will serve as an important benchmark for evaluating and comparing 
      the future works in the field. Furthermore, the findings from this study can 
      potentially be extended to other imaging datasets and modalities, having an 
      impact on the wider medical imaging community.

TI  - Different physiotherapy protocols after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: A 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - e1882
LID - 10.1002/pri.1882 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of 
      different physiotherapy protocols on heart rate variability (HRV) and hospital 
      length of stay in older adults undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). 
      METHODS: Randomized controlled trial with allocation and researcher blinding and 
      intention-to-treat analysis. Forty-eight patients undergoing CABG were randomly 
      assigned to a control group (CG), early mobilization group (EMG), or virtual 
      reality group (VRG). CG performed respiratory physiotherapy and metabolic 
      exercises, the EMG performed cycle ergometer exercises and ambulation, and the 
      VRG performed the same activities as the EMG, with the addition of two Nintendo 
      Wii games during 3 postoperative days. The variables of heart rate variability on 
      preoperative and fourth postoperative day, and time of discharge of hospital was 
      analyzed. RESULTS: The VRG presented a shorter hospital length of stay (p = 
      0.03). The CG showed a decline in HRV from the preoperative period to fourth 
      postoperative day on square root of the mean of the squared differences between 
      successive RR intervals (33.18 ± 9.89-9.74 ± 6.88, p < 0.05), standard deviation 
      of all RR intervals (25.48 ± 7.50-15.23 ± 11.27, p < 0.05), and dispersion of 
      points perpendicular to identity line (28.26 ± 21.6-2.73 ± 1.31, p < 0.05). The 
      EMG and VRG presented a higher cardiac autonomic modulation compared to the CG (p 
      < 0.05), with improved parasympathetic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Different protocols 
      of physiotherapy intervention affected autonomic modulation of the heart rate and 
      hospital length of stay in patients undergoing CABG.

TI  - Virtual and real-life ostracism and its impact on a subsequent acute stressor.
PG  - 113205

AB  - While ostracism constitutes a social stressor with negative effects on physical 
      and mental health, social inclusion seems to increase resilience. This may be 
      true not only for face-to-face settings, but also for computer-mediated 
      interactions. Hence, this study examined the differences between ostracism and 
      social inclusion in real-life or Virtual Reality (VR) regarding self-reported 
      stress, neuroendocrine and cardiovascular reactivity in a subsequent real-life 
      socio-evaluative task. 84 females were randomly assigned to a 3 (agency: 
      face-to-face/human controlled VR-avatar/computer VR-agent) x 2 (inclusion status: 
      inclusion/exclusion) between-subject design using a Cyberball paradigm. 
      Subsequently, they were exposed to a real-life Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). 
      Results indicate that the experience of ostracism constitutes a threat to 
      fundamental social needs independent of agency. Excluded participants showed 
      cardiovascular reactivity during TSST; also face-to-face and avatar excluded 
      individuals had elevated salivary cortisol levels. Included participants reported 
      more perceived social support during Cyberball and showed a blunted cortisol 
      response to the TSST. These results suggest that face-to-face and avatar-related 
      ostracism provokes responses in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and 
      the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Furthermore, they reveal that social 
      inclusion may act as a stress-protector as it alters HPA- and SNS-related stress 
      responsiveness to subsequent stressors.

AB  - Traditional means to stay current in cardiology have been subscription journals 
      and both local and national symposiums. More recently, social media has 
      facilitated a two-way interactive sharing of information. With the use of social 
      media platforms including Twitter, case discussions, educational quizzes and 
      procedural demonstrations can now be shared in a conversation with unlimited 
      parties and represents an excellent interactive educational modality for the 
      global interventional community to share procedural techniques, share opinions 
      and stay current on topics in interventional cardiology.

      sedation during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were included and randomised to VR 
      intervention (n=16) or control (n=16). In the intervention group, 
      patient-selected relaxing 3D videos were projected during the TAVI procedure; 
      pain and anxiety before and after TAVI were measured using visual analogue scales 
      (VAS; 0-10). The median age was 83 years (IQR 78.25-87). Patients' baseline 
      characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups. During TAVI 
      under conscious sedation, the median duration of VR intervention was 30.5 minutes 
      (IQR 23.5-46); 81.3% of the patients watched the videos until device 
      implantation, 37.5% during the whole procedure. The VR intervention group 
      reported significantly less anxiety after the procedure (VAS 2 [IQR 0-3.75] vs 5 
      [IQR 2-8], p=0.04) than patients randomised to control. In the intervention 
      group, 93.8% would use VR during TAVI again. Nausea and vomiting did not occur 
      more frequently compared to control. CONCLUSIONS: VR interventions during TAVI to 
      assist conscious sedation are safe and feasible, even in very old and frail 
      patients. In this small cohort, there was a significant reduction in 
      periprocedural anxiety.

TI  - A Novel Virtual Reality Medical Image Display System for Group Discussions of 
      Congenital Heart Disease: Development and Usability Testing.
PG  - e20633
LID - 10.2196/20633 [doi]
LID - e20633
AB  - BACKGROUND: The complex 3-dimensional (3D) nature of anatomical abnormalities in 
      congenital heart disease (CHD) necessitates multidisciplinary group discussions 
      centered around the review of medical images such as magnetic resonance imaging. 
      Currently, group viewings of medical images are constrained to 2-dimensional (2D) 
      cross-sectional displays of 3D scans. However, 2D display methods could introduce 
      additional challenges since they require physicians to accurately reconstruct the 
      images mentally into 3D anatomies for diagnosis, staging, and planning of surgery 
      or other therapies. Virtual reality (VR) software may enhance diagnosis and care 
      of CHD via 3D visualization of medical images. Yet, present-day VR developments 
      for medicine lack the emphasis on multiuser collaborative environments, and the 
      effect of displays and level of immersion for diagnosing CHDs have not been 
      studied. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the 
      diagnostic accuracies and preferences of various display systems, including the 
      conventional 2D display and a novel group VR software, in group discussions of 
      CHD. METHODS: A total of 22 medical trainees consisting of 1 first-year, 10 
      second-year, 4 third-year, and 1 fourth-year residents and 6 medical students, 
      who volunteered for the study, were formed into groups of 4 to 5 participants. 
      Each group discussed three diagnostic cases of CHD with varying structural 
      complexity using conventional 2D display and group VR software. A group VR 
      software, Cardiac Review 3D, was developed by our team using the Unity engine. By 
      using different display hardware, VR was classified into nonimmersive and 
      full-immersive settings. The discussion time, diagnostic accuracy score, and peer 
      assessment were collected to capture the group and individual diagnostic 
      performances. The diagnostic accuracies for each participant were scored by two 
      experienced cardiologists following a predetermined answer rubric. At the end of 
      the study, all participants were provided a survey to rank their preferences of 
      the display systems for performing group medical discussions. RESULTS: Diagnostic 
      accuracies were highest when groups used the full-immersive VR compared with the 
      conventional and nonimmersive VR (χ(2)(2)=9.0, P=.01) displays. Differences 
      between the display systems were more prominent with increasing case complexity 
      (χ(2)(2)=14.1, P<.001) where full-immersive VR had accuracy scores that were 
      54.49% and 146.82% higher than conventional and nonimmersive VR, respectively. 
      The diagnostic accuracies provided by the two cardiologists for each participant 
      did not statistically differ from each other (t=-1.01, P=.31). The full-immersive 
      VR was ranked as the most preferred display for performing group CHD discussions 
      by 68% of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: The most preferred display system among 
      medical trainees for visualizing medical images during group diagnostic 
      discussions is full-immersive VR, with a trend toward improved diagnostic 
      accuracy in complex anatomical abnormalities. Immersion is a crucial feature of 
      displays of medical images for diagnostic accuracy in collaborative discussions.

TI  - Application and evaluation of virtual technologies for anatomy education to 
      medical students: A review.
PG  - 163
LID - 10.47176/mjiri.34.163 [doi]
AB  - To learn anatomy, medical students need to look at body structures and manipulate 
      anatomical structures. Simulation-based education is a promising opportunity for 
      the upgrade and sharing of knowledge. The purpose of this review is to 
      investigate the evaluation of virtual technologies in teaching anatomy to medical 
      students. METHODS: In this review, we searched PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, 
      and Embase for relevant articles in November 2018. Information retrieval was done 
      without time limitation. The search was based on the following keywords: virtual 
      reality, medical education, and anatomy. RESULTS: 2483 articles were identified 
      by searching databases. Finally, the fulltext of 12 articles was reviewed. The 
      results of the review showed that virtual technologies had been used to train 
      internal human anatomy, ear anatomy, nose anatomy, temporal bone anatomy, 
      surgical anatomy, neuroanatomy, and cardiac anatomy. CONCLUSION: Virtual reality, 
      augmented reality, and games can enhance students' anatomical learning skills and 
      are proper alternatives to traditional methods in case of no access to the 
      cadavers and mannequin.

AB  - Objective: Pulmonary hypertension related to congenital heart disease (PH-CHD) is 
      a devastating disease caused by hemodynamic disorders. Previous hemodynamic 
      research in PH-CHD mainly focused on wall shear stress (WSS). However, energy 
      loss (EL) is a vital parameter in evaluation of hemodynamic status. We 
      investigated if EL of the pulmonary artery (PA) is a potential biomechanical 
      marker for comprehensive assessment of PH-CHD. Materials and Methods: Ten PH-CHD 
      patients and 10 age-matched controls were enrolled. Subject-specific 3-D PA 
      models were reconstructed based on computed tomography. Transient flow, WSS, and 
      EL in the PA were calculated using non-invasive computational fluid dynamics. The 
      relationship between body surface area (BSA)-normalized EL ( E. ) and PA 
      morphology and PA flow were analyzed. Results: Morphologic analysis indicated 
      that the BSA-normalized main PA (MPA) diameter (D(MPAnorm)), MPA/aorta diameter 
      ratio (D(MPA)/D(AO)), and MPA/(left PA + right PA) [D(MPA)/D((LPA+RPA))] diameter 
      ratio were significantly larger in PH-CHD patients. Hemodynamic results showed 
      that the velocity of the PA branches was higher in PH-CHD patients, in whom PA 
      flow rate usually increased. WSS in the MPA was lower and E. was higher in PH-CHD 
      patients. E. was positively correlated with D(MPAnorm), D(MPA)/D(AO), and 
      D(MPA)/D((LPA+RPA)) ratios and the flow rate in the PA. E. was a sensitive index 
      for the diagnosis of PH-CHD. Conclusion: E. is a potential biomechanical marker 
      for PH-CHD assessment. This hemodynamic parameter may lead to new directions for 
      revealing the potential pathophysiologic mechanism of PH-CHD.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted first-line medical staff as well as 
      nursing-student clinical practicum programs. How to cooperate with the 
      government's pandemic-prevention policies and reduce the gap between education 
      and clinical practice represent significant challenges. In this paper, Chang Gung 
      University of Science and Technology (CCUST) is used as an example to show how 
      schools in Taiwan have effectively adapted the fundamentals of nursing practicum 
      programs to the current pandemic using e-learning, group discussions, case 
      analysis, clinical skill practice, and clinical case simulation scenario 
      exercises. The program at CCUST both takes into account the safety of students 
      and has achieved all critical nursing practice goals. After implementation of 
      these adjustments, satisfaction among nursing students with the practicum 
      environment and the clinical instructors was found to be significantly higher for 
      the on-campus clinical practicum than for the off-campus clinical practicum. 
      Furthermore, the results of qualitative data analyses show that nursing students 
      in the on-campus practicum gained significant knowledge and experience and 
      commented positively on their experience. For example, the students indicated 
      that they were satisfied with the simulated clinical environment of the CCC, the 
      teaching strategies and adaptability of the instructor, and the application of 
      virtual reality scenario cases to enhance skill proficiency and learning 
      outcomes. The adjusted nursing clinical practicum described in this paper may be 
      used as a reference to ensure the quality of nursing clinical practicum programs 
      is maintained during epidemics.

TI  - Cultivating Empathy Through Virtual Reality: Advancing Conversations About 
      Racism, Inequity, and Climate in Medicine.
PG  - 1882-1886

AB  - PROBLEM: Racism and bias are fundamental causes of health inequities, and they 
      negatively affect the climate of academic medical institutions across the United 
      States. APPROACH: In 2019, the Zucker School of Medicine and Northwell Health 
      piloted a virtual reality (VR) racism experience as a component of professional 
      development for medical school and health system leaders, faculty, and staff. 
      Participants experienced a 60-minute, interactive, large-group session on 
      microaggressions and, as individuals, a 20-minute VR module. These were followed 
      by group reflection and debriefing. The sessions, developed in collaboration with 
      a VR academic team, represented a response to institutional climate assessment 
      surveys, which indicated the need for expanded professional training on 
      cross-cultural communication and enhancing inclusion. OUTCOMES: In October 2019, 
      112 faculty and staff participated in the workshop. On a postworkshop survey, 
      completed by 76 participants (67.9%), most respondents (90.8%) reported feeling 
      engaged in the VR experience. Additionally, the majority agreed that VR was an 
      effective tool for enhancing empathy (94.7%), that the session enhanced their own 
      empathy for racial minorities (85.5%), and that their approach to communication 
      would change (67.1%). In open-ended responses, participants frequently conveyed 
      enthusiasm, powerful emotional and physiologic responses, and enhanced empathy. 
      They also suggested more time for follow-up discussions. NEXT STEPS: Next steps 
      include assessing the scalability of the VR module; determining effective 
      complementary engagements; and measuring the module's longitudinal effects on 
      racial empathy, discrimination, and institutional climate. As VR becomes more 
      common in medical education, developing VR modules to address other forms of 
      discrimination (e.g., sexism, homophobia) could also benefit the institutional 
      climates of medical schools and health systems as academic medicine continues to 
      build toward health equity.

TI  - Using VR to Investigate the Relationship between Visual Acuity and Severity of 
      Simulated Oscillopsia.
PG  - 1611-1618
LID - 10.1080/02713683.2020.1772834 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Oscillopsia is a debilitating symptom resulting from involuntary eye 
      movement most commonly associated with acquired nystagmus. Investigating and 
      documenting the effects of oscillopsia severity on visual acuity (VA) is 
      challenging. This paper aims to further understanding of the effects of 
      oscillopsia using a virtual reality simulation. METHODS: Fifteen right-beat 
      horizontal nystagmus waveforms, with different amplitude (1°, 3°, 5°, 8° and 11°) 
      and frequency (1.25 Hz, 2.5 Hz and 5 Hz) combinations, were produced and imported 
      into virtual reality to simulate different severities of oscillopsia. Fifty 
      participants without ocular pathology were recruited to read logMAR charts in 
      virtual reality under stationary conditions (no oscillopsia) and subsequently 
      while experiencing simulated oscillopsia. The change in VA (logMAR) was 
      calculated for each oscillopsia simulation (logMAR VA with oscillopsia - logMAR 
      VA with no oscillopsia), removing the influence of different baseline VAs between 
      participants. A one-tailed paired t-test was used to assess statistical 
      significance in the worsening in VA caused by the oscillopsia simulations. 
      RESULTS: VA worsened with each incremental increase in simulated oscillopsia 
      intensity (frequency x amplitude), either by increasing frequency or amplitude, 
      with the exception of statistically insignificant changes at lower intensity 
      simulations. Theoretical understanding predicted a linear relationship between 
      increasing oscillopsia intensity and worsening VA. This was supported by 
      observations at lower intensity simulations but not at higher intensities, with 
      incremental changes in VA gradually levelling off. A potential reason for the 
      difference at higher intensities is the influence of frame rate when using 
      digital simulations in virtual reality. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency and amplitude 
      were found to equally affect VA, as predicted. These results not only consolidate 
      the assumption that VA degrades with oscillopsia but also provide quantitative 
      information that relates these changes to amplitude and frequency of oscillopsia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Fundamentals of Endovascular and Vascular Surgery, a curriculum 
      that includes an endovascular model for skills testing, aims to differentiate 
      between competent and noncompetent performers. The aim of our study was to 
      further validate the model and to test its reliability in assessing the 
      performance of endovascular trainees in an uncontrolled setting. METHODS: The 
      model was tested exclusively in a virtual reality environment. On the basis of 
      their endovascular experience, 52 participants were divided into three groups: 
      novice (<50 endovascular cases), intermediate (50-500 endovascular cases), and 
      expert (>500 endovascular cases). Performance was evaluated in four tasks, 
      measuring the tool tip position and velocity on the virtual model. Average tool 
      tip velocity and movement smoothness in the velocity frequency domain are 
      validated parameters defining proficiency of movement. The data were filtered and 
      interpolated to calculate the metrics. Trials containing critical tool 
      manipulation errors were excluded. RESULTS: In total, 52 tasks completed by 
      novices, 25 completed by intermediates, and 38 completed by experts were analyzed 
      to determine performance. The difference in performance between the novice and 
      expert groups was statistically significant for guidewire smoothness (P < .001). 
      The expert group had a statistically significantly higher average guidewire 
      velocity compared with the novice group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The Fundamentals 
      of Endovascular and Vascular Surgery model continues to differentiate novices 
      from experts on the basis of their handling of guidewire and catheter tools, 
      measured as smoothness and velocity. This model offers a useful instrument to 
      test competency of endovascular surgeons.

TI  - Studying the Effect of Display Type and Viewing Perspective on User Experience in 
      Virtual Reality Exergames.
PG  - 405-414
LID - 10.1089/g4h.2019.0102 [doi]
AB  - Background: Physical inactivity has been identified as the fourth leading cause 
      of death globally. It is now well established that a sedentary lifestyle is a 
      unique risk factor for several diseases such as type 2 diabetes and 
      cardiovascular disease, which account for about 30% of global mortality. Diabetes 
      is a major preventable cause of costly and debilitating renal failure, heart 
      disease, lower limb amputation, and avoidable blindness. In recent years, the 
      idea of using interactive computing systems that leverage gamification to promote 
      physical activity has been widely researched. Prior studies have shown that 
      exergames, that is those that encourage physical activity, can increase enjoyment 
      and intrinsic motivation compared with conventional exercises; as such, they can 
      be effective in promoting physical and mental health. There has been some 
      research on immersive virtual reality (VR) exergames; however, to the best of our 
      knowledge, it is limited and preliminary. This work aims at filling the gap and 
      investigates the effect of display type (DT) and viewing perspective (VP) on 
      players' exertion, engagement, and overall game experience in immersive VR 
      exergames. Objective: This article aims at examining whether DT and VP can affect 
      gameplay performance, players' exertion, game experience, cybersickness, and 
      electroencephalography (EEG) engagement index when playing a gesture-based (i.e., 
      body motion) exergame. Materials and Methods: Study 1 employed a one-way 
      between-subjects design with 24 participants equally distributed in two groups 
      (immersive VR and 50-inch TV) to perform 12 pre-defined gestures. The main 
      outcome measures were National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load 
      Index (NASA-TLX) workload for each group as well as 7 Likert scale and EEG 
      engagement index for each gesture. Study 2 included 16 participants in playing a 
      game with the gestures selected from study 1. All participants played 4 versions 
      based on combinations of DT (immersive VR and 50-inch TV) and VP (first-person 
      and third-person) to assess exertion (%HR(max), calories consumption, and Borg 
      RPE 6-20), game experience, cybersickness, and EEG engagement index. Results: 
      Study 1 results showed that DT had no effect on the ratings of the gestures, 
      NASA-TLX workload, and EEG engagement index. Study 2 results showed that 
      immersive VR not only resulted in a significantly higher exertion (%HR(max), 
      calories consumption, and Borg RPE) but also helped achieve better positive game 
      experience in challenge, flow, sensory and imaginative immersion, as well as 
      lower negative affect. We also found that nausea and oculomotor were 
      significantly higher in immersive VR. Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrates 
      that youth who played gesture-based exergame in immersive VR had a higher level 
      of exertion (%HR(max,) calories consumption, and Borg RPE), although the number 
      of performed gestures were not significantly different. They also felt that 
      immersive VR was much more challenging, immersive (flow, sensory and imaginative 
      immersion), and had a lower negative affect than a 50-inch TV; however, immersive 
      VR was more likely to make youth have higher cybersickness.

AB  - Potential attributes of virtual reality (VR) can be a breakthrough in the 
      improvement of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) training. However, interference with 
      the virtual world is associated with the need of placing additional equipment on 
      the trainee's body. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate if it does not 
      affect the quality of chest compressions (CCs).91 voluntarily included in the 
      study medical students participated twice in the scenario of SCA - Traditional 
      Scenario (TS) and Virtual Reality Scenario (VRS). In both cases two minutes of 
      resuscitation was performed.If VRS was the first scenario there were significant 
      differences in CCs depth (VRS - Me = 47 mm [IQR 43 - 52] vs TS - Me = 48 mm [IQR 
      43 - 55]; P = .02) and chest relaxation (VRS - Me = 37% [IQR 5 - 91] vs TS - 
      Me = 97% [IQR 87 - 100]; P < .001). 97.8% of respondents believe that training 
      with the use of VR is more effective than a traditional method (P < .01). Most of 
      the study group (91%, P < .01) denied any negative symptoms during the VR 
      scenario.Virtual reality can be a safe and highly valued by medical students, 
      method of hands-on CPR training. However additional VR equipment placed on the 
      trainee's body may cause chest compressions harder to provide. If it is not 
      preceded by traditional training, the use of VR may have an adverse impact on 
      depth and full chest relaxation during the training. To make the best use of all 
      the potential that virtual reality offers, future studies should focus on finding 
      the most effective way to combine VR with traditional skill training in CPR 
      courses curriculum.

TI  - Studying the Factors of Human Carotid Atherosclerotic Plaque Rupture, by 
      Calculating Stress/Strain in the Plaque, Based on CEUS Images: A Numerical Study.

AB  - Carotid plaque neovascularization is one of the major factors for the 
      classification of vulnerable plaque, but the axial force effects of the pulsatile 
      blood flow on the plaque with neovessel and intraplaque hemorrhage was unclear. 
      Together with the severity of stenosis, the fibrous cap thickness, large lipid 
      core, and the neovascularization followed by intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) have 
      been regarded as high-risk features of plaque rupture. In this work, the effects 
      of these factors were evaluated on the progression and rupture of the carotid 
      atherosclerotic plaques. Five geometries of carotid artery plaque were developed 
      based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) images, which contain two types of 
      neovessel and IPH, and geometry without neovessel and IPH. A one-way 
      fluid-structure interaction model was applied to compute the maximum principal 
      stress and strain in the plaque. For that hyper-elastic and non-linear material, 
      Yeoh 3rd Order strain energy density function was used for components of the 
      plaque. The simulation results indicated that the maximum principal stress of 
      plaque in the carotid artery was higher when the degree of the luminal stenosis 
      increased and the thickness of the fibrous cap decreased. The neovessels within 
      the plaque could introduce a 2.5% increments of deformation in the plaque under 
      the pulsatile blood flow pressure. The IPH also contributed to the increased risk 
      of plaque rupture that a gain of stress was 8.983, 14.526, and 34.47 kPa for the 
      plaque with 50, 65, and 75%, respectively, when comparing stress in the plaque 
      with IPH distributed at the middle to the shoulder of the plaque. In conclusion, 
      neovascularization in the plaque could reduce the stability of the plaque by 
      increasing the stress within the plaque. Also, the risk of plaque rupture 
      increased when large luminal stenosis, thin fibrous cap, and IPH were observed.

AB  - Individuals differ in their physiological responsiveness to stressful challenges, 
      and stress potentiates the development of many diseases. Heart rate variability 
      (HRV), a measure of cardiac vagal break, is emerging as a strong index of 
      physiological stress vulnerability. Thus, it is important to develop tools that 
      identify predictive markers of individual differences in HRV responsiveness 
      without exposing subjects to high stress. Here, using machine learning 
      approaches, we show the strong predictive power of high-dimensional locomotor 
      responses during novelty exploration to predict HRV responsiveness during stress 
      exposure. Locomotor responses are collected in two ecologically valid virtual 
      reality scenarios inspired by the animal literature and stress is elicited and 
      measured in a third threatening virtual scenario. Our model's predictions 
      generalize to other stressful challenges and outperforms other stress prediction 
      instruments, such as anxiety questionnaires. Our study paves the way for the 
      development of behavioral digital phenotyping tools for early detection of 
      stress-vulnerable individuals.

AB  - It is well-established that physical exercise in humans improves cognitive 
      functions, such as executive functions, pattern separation, and working memory. 
      It is yet unknown, however, whether spatial learning, long known to be affected 
      by exercise in rodents, is also affected in humans. In order to address this 
      question, we recruited 20 healthy young male adults (18-30 years old) divided 
      into exercise and control groups (n = 10 in each group). The exercise group 
      performed three sessions per week of mild-intensity aerobic exercise for 12 
      weeks, while the control group was instructed not to engage in any physical 
      activity. Both groups performed maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)) tests to assess 
      their cardiovascular fitness at baseline and every 4 weeks through the 12 weeks 
      of the training program. The effects of mild aerobic exercise were tested on 
      performance in two different virtual reality (VR)-based spatial learning tasks: 
      (1) virtual Morris water maze (VMWM) and (2) virtual Radial arm water maze 
      (VRAWM). Subjects were tested in both tasks at baseline prior to the training 
      program and at the end of 12 weeks training program. While the mild-intensity 
      aerobic exercise did not affect subjects' VO(2max) parameters, mean time to 
      anaerobic threshold increased for the exercise group compared with control. No 
      effect was observed, however, on performance in the VMWM or VRAWM between the two 
      groups. Based on these results, we suggest that mild-intensity aerobic exercise 
      does not improve spatial learning and memory in young, healthy adults.

TI  - Effects of Virtual Reality on Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs for Ischemic Heart 
      Disease: A Randomized Pilot Clinical Trial.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17228472 [doi]
LID - 8472
AB  - (1) Background: The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of a 
      virtual reality (VR) program, as a complementary tool to a conventional cardiac 
      rehabilitation (CR) program in phase II of patients with ischemic heart disease 
      compared to a conventional treatment group. (2) Methods: A single blinded 
      randomized clinical trial was conducted. The patients were randomized to a 
      control group (CG) or an experimental group (EG). The EG carried out a training 
      based on VR of aerobic exercise using the XBOX ONE console and Kinect sensor. 
      Ergometry, metabolic equivalents (METS), Functional Independence Measure, 6-min 
      walk test (6MWT), the Short Form Health Survey-36 Questionnaire (SF-36), the Beck 
      Depression Inventory-II, and the degree of satisfaction and adherence to 
      treatment were used as outcome measures. (3) Results: Our results showed no 
      statistically significant differences between the two groups. Statistical 
      analysis within group for the EG showed statistically significant changes in the 
      variables HR final ergometry, ergometry minutes, % ergometry, METS, final HR 
      6MWT, 6MWT distance, 6MWT number of laps, and for the SF-36 and Beck Depression 
      Inventory-II. (4) Conclusion: A VR-based video game program, as an adjunct tool 
      to a CR program, showed improvements in ergometry, METS, resistance to fatigue 
      and health-related quality of life with excellent adherence and satisfaction 
      perceived by patients with ischemic heart disease in phase II.

AB  - Comprehensive appreciation of the 3-dimensional anatomy of the living heart is 
      essential for accurate diagnosis and establishment of safe interventional 
      treatment by clinical electrophysiologists. Three-dimensional images displayed on 
      a 2-dimensional surface usually undergo distortion and are not considered a real 
      3-dimensional representation because they cannot provide accurate depth 
      perception. Currently, the availability of 3-dimensional visualization 
      techniques, including 3-dimensional printing, 3-dimensional projectors, 
      3-dimensional monitors, and virtual reality, is limited owing to their limited 
      user-friendliness and high costs. The authors discuss an alternative conventional 
      approach of a cross-eyed method for viewing stereoscopically displayed images for 
      better appreciation of real 3-dimensional images based on a simple technique.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency procedure that 
      can increase survival after a cardiac arrest. Performing CPR effectively requires 
      both procedural knowledge and manual skills. Traditional CPR training methodology 
      includes lessons led by instructors and supervised practice on mannequins, thus 
      requiring considerable resources. OBJECTIVE: This paper proposes a new 
      methodology for low-cost CPR training based on virtual reality (VR) with and 
      without the addition of a physical mannequin. Moreover, it describes an 
      experimental evaluation of the methodology that assessed gain in manual skills 
      during training, transfer of procedural knowledge and manual skills in a final 
      assessment, and changes in self-efficacy with three measurements over time 
      (pre-training, post-training, and post-assessment). METHODS: We implemented a VR 
      application that supports the proposed methodology, and can thus be used with or 
      without a mannequin. The experimental evaluation involved 30 participants who 
      tried CPR in VR twice, performing two repetitions of 30 chest compressions per 
      trial. Half participants tried the VR application with the mannequin and half 
      without it. Final assessment required all participants to perform CPR on the 
      mannequin without the assistance of VR. To assess self-efficacy, participants 
      filled in a questionnaire at the three times of measurement. RESULTS: 
      Mixed-design ANOVAs showed effects of repetition, effects of group, or 
      interaction between the two variables on manual skills assessed during training. 
      In the final assessment, participants in both groups correctly remembered most of 
      the steps of the procedure. ANOVAs revealed differences between the two groups 
      only in pressure-related skills (better with mannequin) and in the number of 
      wrong steps added to the procedure (better without mannequin). Mixed-design ANOVA 
      showed a self-efficacy increase in both groups after training, which was 
      maintained after final assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed VR methodology for 
      CPR training has a positive effect on procedural knowledge, manual skills, and 
      self-efficacy, with as well as without the physical mannequin. Trials on a 
      mannequin are required to understand the correct pressure for chest compression. 
      This supports the adoption of the proposed VR methodology to reduce instructor 
      and mannequin time required to teach CPR to trainees.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional echocardiographic (3DE) imaging and cardiac 
      computed tomographic (CCT) imaging are important cardiac imaging tools. Despite 
      the three-dimensional nature of these image acquisitions and reconstructions, 
      they are visualized on two-dimensional monitors with shading and coloring to 
      create the illusion of three dimensions. Virtual reality (VR) is a novel tool 
      that allows true three-dimensional visualization and manipulation. The aims of 
      this study were to test the feasibility of converting 3DE and CCT data into 
      three-dimensional VR models, compare the variability of measurements performed in 
      VR and conventional software, assess the diagnostic quality of VR models, and 
      understand the value of VR over conventional viewing. METHODS: Custom software 
      with clinically relevant postprocessing tools (interactively adjustable 
      visualization parameters, multiplanar reconstructions, cropping planes, and 
      nonplanar measurements) was developed to convert 3DE and CCT data into VR models. 
      Anatomic measurements of 15 3DE and 15 CCT data sets of the mitral valve were 
      compared using conventional software and in the VR environment. Additionally, the 
      diagnostic quality of the VR models created from 3DE and CCT data sets was 
      assessed. RESULTS: The 3DE and CCT data sets were successfully converted into VR 
      models in <3 min. The measurement variabilities were reduced by 40% (20.1% vs 
      12.2%) for 3DE imaging and 34% (15.3% vs 10.1%) for CCT imaging by using VR. The 
      mean time needed for measurements was reduced by 31% (from 61 to 42 sec) for 3DE 
      imaging and 39% (from 37 to 23 sec) for CCT imaging. Most users reported facile 
      manipulation of VR models, diagnostic quality visualization of the anatomy, and 
      high confidence in the measurements. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the 
      feasibility of converting 3DE and CCT data into diagnostic-quality VR models. 
      Compared with conventional imaging, VR analysis is associated with faster 
      navigation and accurate measurements with lower variability.

AB  - 3D visualization technologies have evolved to become a mainstay in the management 
      of congenital heart disease (CHD) with a growing presence within multiple facets. 
      Printed and virtual 3D models allow for a more comprehensive approach to 
      educating trainees and care team members. Computational fluid dynamics can take 
      3D modeling to the next level, by predicting post-procedural outcomes and helping 
      to determine surgical approach. 3D printing and extended reality are developing 
      resources for pre-procedural planning and intra-procedural guidance with the 
      potential to revolutionize decision-making and procedural success. Challenges 
      still remain within existing technologies and their applications to the CHD 
      field. Addressing these gaps, both by those within and outside of CHD, will 
      transform education and patient care within our field.

AB  - The intestine and the brain are connected via the brain-gut axis and the 
      intestinal microbiota influences the immune activation and signaling molecules 
      that are involved in the stress response. The aim of the study was to investigate 
      if intake of the probiotic strain Lactiplantibacillus plantarum HEAL9 (LPHEAL9) 
      for four weeks could counteract elevated cortisol and inflammation levels in 
      subjects with chronic stress that are exposed to an acute stress test (Trier 
      Social Stress Test, TSST). Seventy participants were included, and 63 
      participants completed the study (LPHEAL9, n = 32; placebo, n  =  31). 
      Cardiovascular reactivity and cortisol levels were affected by the TSST, but no 
      differences between the groups were observed. Intake of LPHEAL9 did, however, 
      result in significantly decreased plasma levels of two inflammatory markers 
      (soluble fractalkine and CD163) compared to placebo. In conclusion, intake of 
      LPHEAL9 for four weeks may reduce inflammatory markers coupled to acute stress in 
      chronically stressed individuals.

TI  - Investigating Reflexive Responses to Explicit and Implicit Forms of Social 
      Exclusion Using Immersive Virtual Environment Technology.

AB  - Humans are strongly affected by social exclusion, a multifaceted and complex 
      phenomenon of social life. However, individuals tend to respond differently 
      depending on a multitude of individual and contextual factors. Firstly, with a 
      view to increasing the ecological validity and experimental control of an 
      exclusion manipulation in the laboratory setting, we made use of immersive 
      virtual environment technology (IVET; an Oculus Rift Virtual Reality headset) to 
      create a new exclusion paradigm. Secondly, given that a recent meta-analytic 
      report on reflexive responses (i.e., affect and physiology) to manipulations of 
      exclusion in the laboratory setting cites inconsistencies across findings 
      (Blackhart et al., 2009), we focused on the form of exclusion manipulated to 
      illustrate how this factor may help to explain the divergences in responses. We 
      thus investigated how explicit and implicit forms of social exclusion may have a 
      differential impact on self-reported affect, as well as on electrodermal and 
      cardiovascular activity. Results from this laboratory study conducted with a 
      varied sample of the local population made salient the affordances of IVET as a 
      tool in exclusion research. They also helped to reconcile the conflicting 
      findings in the literature relating to differences in the level of negative 
      affect generated and shed light on physiological arousal in the wake of being 
      excluded in different ways.

TI  - Grade IV Liver Injury Following Mechanical Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation with

PG  - 306-308
LID - 10.4103/JETS.JETS_28_20 [doi]
AB  - A 48-year-old female presented to the emergency department with chest pain and 
      collapsed at the front desk. She was reanimated with mechanical chest 
      compression, and after coronary angiography, a left anterior descending/diagonal 
      bifurcation mini-crush stenting was performed. Few hours after the procedure, the 
      patient showed severe hypotension. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography 
      (CT) scan evidenced a massive subcapsular liver hematoma (Grade IV, American 
      association for the surgery of trauma (AAST) liver injury scale) of the right 
      lobe with extrahepatic blushing. Transhepatic embolization was attempted but 
      without benefit, so the patient underwent emergency laparotomy for damage control 
      surgery with perihepatic packing. After hemodynamic stabilization, right 
      hepatectomy was performed with a favorable outcome and full recovery. The patient 
      CT scan was retrospectively processed to obtain a virtual model visualizable 
      through a head-mounted display. The virtual reconstruction could improve the 
      comprehension of the injury and the liver surgical anatomy for educational 
      purpose, and it could represent a new tool for preoperative planning.

AB  - This article aims to summarize some of the key advances in congenital 
      interventional cardiology over the past few years, from novel imaging 
      technologies, such as virtual reality, fusion imaging, and 3-dimensional printed 
      models, to newly available devices and techniques to facilitate complex 
      procedures including percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement and hybrid 
      procedures. It is an exciting time for the field, with rapid development of 
      techniques, devices, and imaging tools that allow a minimally invasive approach 
      for many congenital cardiac defects with progressively less radiation and 
      contrast doses.

PG  - 1617-1623
LID - 10.1007/s00247-020-04758-2 [doi]
AB  - This is a proof-of-concept study to create a four-dimensional (4-D) cine model of 
      the heart and visualize it in virtual reality by using freely available 
      open-source software and inexpensive hardware. Four-dimensional cine models allow 
      for real-time visualization of cardiac structures during processes such as 
      complex congenital heart disease. Such models can be used for patient and trainee 
      education, and potentially for surgical planning. Currently, 3-D printed models 
      are more commonly used, but they are static, showing only one selected phase of 
      the cardiac cycle. Second, they are limited by the selection of clipping planes 
      before printing. Four-dimensional segmentation and virtual reality visualization 
      overcome these limitations. Currently, most of the work in virtual/augmented 
      reality models involves the segmentation of one cardiac phase or the use of 
      expensive software for multiphase segmentation. In this study, we show an 
      approach for multiphase cardiac segmentation as well as its display using free 
      open-source software and relatively inexpensive hardware.

TI  - Virtual genetic diagnosis for familial hypercholesterolemia powered by machine 
      learning.
PG  - 1639-1646
LID - 10.1177/2047487319898951 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common genetic disorder of 
      lipid metabolism. The gold standard for FH diagnosis is genetic testing, 
      available, however, only in selected university hospitals. Clinical scores - for 
      example, the Dutch Lipid Score - are often employed as alternative, more 
      accessible, albeit less accurate FH diagnostic tools. The aim of this study is to 
      obtain a more reliable approach to FH diagnosis by a "virtual" genetic test using 
      machine-learning approaches. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used three machine-learning 
      algorithms (a classification tree (CT), a gradient boosting machine (GBM), a 
      neural network (NN)) to predict the presence of FH-causative genetic mutations in 
      two independent FH cohorts: the FH Gothenburg cohort (split into training data 
      (N = 174) and internal test (N = 74)) and the FH-CEGP Milan cohort (external 
      test, N = 364). By evaluating their area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic (AUROC) curves, we found that the three machine-learning 
      algorithms performed better (AUROC 0.79 (CT), 0.83 (GBM), and 0.83 (NN) on the 
      Gothenburg cohort, and 0.70 (CT), 0.78 (GBM), and 0.76 (NN) on the Milan cohort) 
      than the clinical Dutch Lipid Score (AUROC 0.68 and 0.64 on the Gothenburg and 
      Milan cohorts, respectively) in predicting carriers of FH-causative mutations. 
      CONCLUSION: In the diagnosis of FH-causative genetic mutations, all three 
      machine-learning approaches we have tested outperform the Dutch Lipid Score, 
      which is the clinical standard. We expect these machine-learning algorithms to 
      provide the tools to implement a virtual genetic test of FH. These tools might 
      prove particularly important for lipid clinics without access to genetic testing.

TI  - The Effects of High-intensity Functional Training (HIFT) on Spatial Learning, 
      Visual Pattern Separation and Attention Span in Adolescents.

AB  - Aerobic, anaerobic, and strength exercises are known to improve various cognitive 
      functions, such as executive functions, pattern separation, and working memory. 
      High-intensity functional training (HIFT) is a form of physical activity that can 
      be modified to any fitness level and elicits greater muscle recruitment than 
      repetitive aerobic exercises, thereby improving cardiovascular endurance, 
      strength, and flexibility. HIFT emphasizes functional, multi-joint movements via 
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and muscle-strengthening exercises. It is 
      yet unknown, however, whether HIFT affects cognitive functions in adolescents. To 
      address this question, we subjected adolescents to 3 × 20 min training 
      sessions/week of HIFT for 3 months. The effects of HIFT were tested on 
      performance in: (1) virtual reality (VR)-based spatial learning task; (2) 
      computerized visual pattern separation; and (3) attention span. The control group 
      performed a typical physical class three times per week. The effects on cognition 
      were tested at baseline and following 3 months of HIFT. Three months into the 
      intervention, the HIFT group achieved higher scores in the spatial learning task, 
      pattern separation task, and in the attention span test, compared with controls. 
      These data suggest that HIFT can potentially translate into improving school 
      performance in adolescents.

TI  - Assessing the Relationship between Sense of Agency, the Bodily-Self and Stress: 
      Four Virtual-Reality Experiments in Healthy Individuals.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9092931 [doi]
LID - 2931
AB  - The bodily-self, our experience of being a body, arises from the interaction of 
      several processes. For example, embodied Sense of Agency (SoA), the feeling of 
      controlling our body's actions, is a fundamental facet of the bodily-self. SoA is 
      disturbed in psychosis, with stress promoting its inception. However, there is 
      little knowledge regarding the relationship between SoA, stress, and other facets 
      of the bodily-self. In four experiments manipulating embodied SoA using a virtual 
      hand (VH), we examined (1) How is embodied SoA related to other facets of the 
      bodily-self?; and (2) How is SoA impacted by stress? We found that increased 
      alteration of the VH significantly decreased subjective ratings of SoA and body 
      ownership (Exp. 1), supporting the close relation between SoA and body ownership. 
      Interoceptive accuracy and SoA were positively correlated (Exp. 3), connecting 
      awareness to one's actions and cardiac signals. Contrary to our expectations, SoA 
      was not related to trait anxiety (Exp. 3), nor did induced stress impair SoA 
      (Exp. 4). Finally, we found a negative correlation between self-reported 
      prodromal symptoms and SoA. These results strongly support the connection between 
      SoA and the bodily-self. Whereas, SoA was not impaired by stress, and weakly 
      related to psychotic symptoms.

TI  - Comparison of acute response of cardiac autonomic modulation between virtual 
      reality-based therapy and cardiovascular rehabilitation: a cluster-randomized 
      crossover trial.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1080/09593985.2020.1815261 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the acute response of cardiac autonomic modulation (ACAM) 
      during and after a session of virtual reality-based therapy (VRBT) compared to a 
      session of conventional cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) and to evaluate the 
      effects of 12 weeks of training on this response. METHODS: We assessed 28 
      volunteers (63.4 ± 12.5 years). The ACAM was judged by linear indexes of heart 
      rate variability (HRV) in VRBT and CR sessions. Later, patients completed 
      12 weeks of VRBT+CR and the assessment was repeated at the 12(th) week. RESULTS: 
      Throughout the 1(st) VRBT session vagal withdrawal occurred (RMSSD/HFnu); 
      sympathetic nervous system stimulation (LFnu) and progressive decrease of global 
      HRV (SDNN). During the recovery, the SDNN, HFnu, and LFnu improved from the 
      5(th)minute on both therapies. After 12 weeks, the LFnu, HFnu, and the 
      LF/HF-ratio revealed no significant changes in Ex3-Ex4 equated to Rep during 
      VRBT. In recovery, the HFnu and LFnu improved before the 5(th)minute on both 
      therapies. CONCLUSIONS: ACAM during and after the VRBT was comparable to CR, yet, 
      the extents were greater in the VRBT. After 12 weeks of VRBT training, the 
      subjects adapted to the exercises from the 15(th)minute and exhibited faster 
      recovery of HFnu and LFnu indexes compared to the 1(st) week.

AB  - We present the case of an nine-year-old girl with double outlet right ventricle 
      with noncommitted ventricular septal defect and malposition of the great arteries 
      who had undergone repair at the age of seven months. Six years later, the patient 
      presented with right ventricular failure, conduit calcification with obstruction, 
      and obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Three-dimensional models 
      reconstructed by Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images of 
      the patient were visualized in a virtual reality system to help plan the surgical 
      correction of the intracardiac congenital anomalies. This tool allowed us to 
      inspect the intracardiac anatomy in an immersive environment with a clearer sense 
      of perspective.

TI  - ACC.20: Impact of social media at the virtual scientific sessions during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic.
PG  - 944-948
LID - 10.1002/clc.23387 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 
      Annual Scientific Session 2020 (ACC.20) being held as a virtual event. 
      HYPOTHESIS: Social media activity around a virtual event might be quite different 
      to that of a physical meeting. The goal of this study was to assess impact of 
      ACC.20 through Twitter and compare it to ACC.19. METHODS: Data were extracted 
      using NodeXL, with analysis in Excel. RESULTS: ACC.20-related tweeting was 
      demonstrated globally. However tweeting and participants fell substantially for 
      ACC.20. Tweeting, participation and tweet views were overestimated by the most 
      widely used social media analysis tool used at medical conferences (Symplur). 
      CONCLUSION: Comparing the 2019 and 2020 Scientific Sessions, the global 
      cardiology community continued to communicate despite COVID-19, but with reduced 
      social media activity potentially due to the briefer format, no physical 
      interaction and private virtual chatroom during live sessions, reducing 
      visibility of new cardiology research findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antitachycardia pacing (ATP) success rates as low as 50% for fast 
      ventricular tachycardias (VTs) have been reported providing an opportunity for 
      improved ATP to decrease shocks. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to 
      determine how a new automated antitachycardia pacing (AATP) therapy would perform 
      compared with traditional burst ATP using computer modeling to conduct a virtual 
      study. METHODS: Virtual patient scenarios were constructed from magnetic 
      resonance imaging and electrophysiological (EP) data. Cardiac EP simulation 
      software (CARPEntry) was used to generate reentrant VT. Simulated VT exit sites 
      were physician adjudicated against corresponding clinical 12-lead 
      electrocardiograms. Burst ATP comprised 3 sequences of 8 pulses at 88% of VT 
      cycle length, with each sequence decremented by 10 ms. AATP was limited to 3 
      sequences, with each sequence learning from the previous sequences. RESULTS: Two 
      hundred fifty-nine unique ATP scenarios were generated from 7 unique scarred 
      hearts. Burst ATP terminated 145 of 259 VTs (56%) and accelerated 2.0%. AATP 
      terminated 189 of 259 VTs (73%) with the same acceleration rate. The 2 dominant 
      ATP failure mechanisms were identified as (1) insufficient prematurity to close 
      the excitable gap; and (2) failure to reach the critical isthmus of the VT. AATP 
      reduced failures in these categories from 101 to 63 (44% reduction) without 
      increasing acceleration. CONCLUSION: AATP successfully adapted ATP sequences to 
      terminate VT episodes that burst ATP failed to terminate. AATP was successful 
      with complex scar geometries and EP heterogeneity as seen in the real world.

AB  - Micro-CT scan images enhanced by iodine staining provide high-resolution 
      visualisation of soft tissues in laboratory mice. We have compared Micro-CT 
      scan-derived left ventricular (LV) mass with dissection and weighing. Ex-vivo 
      micro-CT scan images of the mouse hearts were obtained following staining by 
      iodine. The LV was segmented and its volume was assessed using a semi-automated 
      method by Drishti software. The left ventricle was then dissected in the 
      laboratory and its actual weight was measured and compared against the estimated 
      results. LV mass was calculated multiplying its estimated volume and myocardial 
      specific gravity. Thirty-five iodine-stained post-natal mouse hearts were 
      studied. Mice were of either sex and 68 to 352 days old (median age 202 days with 
      interquartile range 103 to 245 days) at the time of sacrifice. Samples were from 
      20 genetically diverse strains. Median mouse body weight was 29 g with 
      interquartile range 24 to 34 g. Left Ventricular weights ranged from 40.0 to 
      116.7 mg. The segmented LV mass estimated from micro-CT scan and directly 
      measured dissected LV mass were strongly correlated (R(2) = 0. 97). Segmented LV 
      mass derived from Micro-CT images was very similar to the physically dissected LV 
      mass (mean difference = 0.09 mg; 95% confidence interval - 3.29 mg to 3.1 mg). 
      Micro-CT scanning provides a non-destructive, efficient and accurate 
      visualisation tool for anatomical analysis of animal heart models of human 
      cardiovascular conditions. Iodine-stained soft tissue imaging empowers 
      researchers to perform qualitative and quantitative assessment of the cardiac 
      structures with preservation of the samples for future histological analysis.

TI  - Exploring User Needs in the Development of a Virtual Reality-Based Advanced Life 
      Support Training Platform: Exploratory Usability Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional methods of delivering Advanced Life Support (ALS) 
      training and reaccreditation are resource-intensive and costly. Interactive 
      simulations and gameplay using virtual reality (VR) technology can complement 
      traditional training processes as a cost-effective, engaging, and flexible 
      training tool. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study aimed to determine the specific 
      user needs of clinicians engaging with a new interactive VR ALS simulation 
      (ALS-SimVR) application to inform the ongoing development of such training 
      platforms. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with experienced 
      clinicians (n=10, median age=40.9 years) following a single playthrough of the 
      application. All clinicians have been directly involved in the delivery of ALS 
      training in both clinical and educational settings (median years of ALS 
      experience=12.4; all had minimal or no VR experience). Interviews were 
      supplemented with an assessment of usability (using heuristic evaluation) and 
      presence. RESULTS: The ALS-SimVR training app was well received. Thematic 
      analysis of the interviews revealed five main areas of user needs that can inform 
      future design efforts for creating engaging VR training apps: affordances, 
      agency, diverse input modalities, mental models, and advanced roles. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study was conducted to identify the needs of clinicians engaging with 
      ALS-SimVR. However, our findings revealed broader design considerations that will 
      be crucial in guiding future work in this area. Although aligning the training 
      scenarios with accepted teaching algorithms is important, our findings reveal 
      that improving user experience and engagement requires careful attention to 
      technology-specific issues such as input modalities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of virtual reality 
      meditation on sleep quality of intensive care unit patients. METHODS: This 
      randomised controlled trial included 48 cardiac intensive care unit patients in a 
      university hospital in Korea randomly allocated to the experimental (24) and the 
      control group (24). For the experimental group, meditation was provided for 
      30 minutes using a head-mounted display for virtual reality, on the evening of 
      the admission day. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The sleep quality of both groups was 
      measured by self-report using Sleep Scale A and the activity tracker FitBit 
      Charge 2. RESULTS: The experimental group reported significantly higher 
      subjective sleep quality than did the control group. Activity tracker assessment 
      indicated that total sleep time and light sleep time did not differ between the 
      groups. However, the awake time was shorter, deep sleep time was longer and sleep 
      efficiency was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control 
      group. CONCLUSION: Virtual reality meditation positively affected the sleep 
      quality of intensive care unit patients. Critical care nurses should consider 
      using virtual reality meditation as a nursing intervention to improve the 
      patient's sleep quality.

TI  - Mechanisms of the breathing contribution to bodily self-consciousness in healthy 
      humans: Lessons from machine-assisted breathing?
PG  - e13564
LID - 10.1111/psyp.13564 [doi]
LID - e13564
AB  - Previous studies investigated bodily self-consciousness (BSC) by experimentally 
      exposing subjects to multisensory conflicts (i.e., visuo-tactile, audio-tactile, 
      visuo-cardiac) in virtual reality (VR) that involve the participant's torso in a 
      paradigm known as the full-body illusion (FBI). Using a modified FBI paradigm, we 
      found that synchrony of visuo-respiratory stimulation (i.e., a flashing outline 
      surrounding an avatar in VR; the flash intensity depending on breathing), is also 
      able to modulate BSC by increasing self-location and breathing agency toward the 
      virtual body. Our aim was to investigate such visuo-respiratory effects and 
      determine whether respiratory motor commands contributes to BSC, using 
      non-invasive mechanical ventilation (i.e., machine-delivered breathing). 
      Seventeen healthy participants took part in a visuo-respiratory FBI paradigm and 
      performed the FBI during two breathing conditions: (a) "active breathing" (i.e., 
      participants actively initiate machine-delivered breaths) and (b) "passive 
      breathing" (i.e., breaths' timing was determined by the machine). Respiration 
      rate, tidal volume, and their variability were recorded. In line with previous 
      results, participants experienced subjective changes in self-location, breathing 
      agency, and self-identification toward the avatar's body, when presented with 
      synchronous visuo-respiratory stimulation. Moreover, drift in self-location was 
      reduced and tidal volume variability were increased by asynchronous 
      visuo-respiratory stimulations. Such effects were not modulated by breathing 
      control manipulations. Our results extend previous FBI findings showing that 
      visuo-respiratory stimulation affects BSC, independently from breathing motor 
      command initiation. Also, variability of respiratory parameters was influenced by 
      visuo-respiratory feedback and might reduce breathing discomfort. Further 
      exploration of such findings might inform the development of respiratory 
      therapeutic tools using VR in patients.

TI  - Callous-unemotional traits and fearlessness: A cardiovascular psychophysiological 
      perspective in two adolescent samples using virtual reality.
PG  - 803-815
LID - 10.1017/S0954579419001196 [doi]
AB  - There has been a longstanding debate about the link between callous-unemotional 
      traits and fearlessness. However, biological evidence for a relationship in 
      adolescents is lacking. Using two adolescent samples, we measured emotional 
      reactivity and cardiac measures of sympathetic (pre-ejection period) and 
      parasympathetic (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) reactivity during 3D TV and 
      virtual reality fear induction. Study 1 included 62 community adolescents from a 
      stratified sample. Study 2 included 60 adolescents from Emotional and Behavioral 
      Difficulties schools. Results were consistent across both studies. Adolescents 
      with high callous-unemotional traits showed coactivation of the sympathetic and 
      parasympathetic nervous system. Consistent with these results, youths with 
      callous-unemotional traits self-reported that they felt more in control after the 
      fear induction. Thus, in both samples, youth with callous-unemotional traits 
      displayed a physiological and emotional profile suggesting they maintained 
      control during fear induction. Therefore, it is proposed here that a shift in 
      thinking of youth with callous-unemotional traits as fearless to youth with 
      callous-unemotional traits are better able to manage fearful situations, may be 
      more appropriate.

AB  - Over the past decade, advances in digital trends and technology have greatly 
      impacted the medical field with rapid delivery of and access to information. The 
      field of cardiovascular medicine in particular has seen major technological 
      advances and is well versed in the use of digital platforms and social media. In 
      these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic, social media and other 
      digital platforms are essential tools for communication, education, and delivery 
      of information. In this review, we discuss the ways virtual learning and social 
      media are changing medical education and research.

AB  - Trainees require extensive experience to perform radical hysterectomy. Before 
      starting training during an actual operation, trainees should be familiar with 
      the pelvic anatomy and should simulate surgical procedures. Many simulators are 
      available for virtual reality training of laparoscopic operations, but they are 
      very expensive. The materials required to construct our model included sponges 
      and colored wires sold in home improvement stores that allowed for superior cost 
      effectiveness. The model represented almost all peripheral vessels and nerves 
      around the uterus, including the minor vessels. Attaching and detaching the 
      vessels was easy, facilitating reconstruction of the dissected vessels. The wires 
      were easy to bend, ensuring high operability. This model allows for the 
      simulation of laparoscopic radical hysterectomy in a dry box. Our model was 
      superior to a 2-dimensional picture for the memorization of branching and 
      positional relationships of the blood vessels. Comparison of our model with 
      actual operative videos showed that the dry box provided an identical surgical 
      view of an actual laparoscopic radical hysterectomy. We developed a peripheral 
      bloodstream model of the uterus for repeated simulation of laparoscopic radical 
      hysterectomy with an actual surgical view using a dry box.

      Systematic Review.
PG  - 1603-1611
LID - 10.21873/invivo.11950 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this systematic review was to identify the challenges imposed on 
      medical and surgical education by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the proposed 
      innovations enabling the continuation of medical student and resident training. A 
      systematic review on the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed on April 
      18th, 2020, and yielded 1288 articles. Sixty-one of the included manuscripts were 
      synthesized in a qualitative description focused on two major axes, "challenges" 
      and "innovative solutions", and two minor axes, "mental health" and "medical 
      students in the frontlines". Shortage of personal protective equipment, 
      suspension of clinical clerkships and observerships and reduction in elective 
      surgical cases unavoidably affect medical and surgical education. Interesting 
      solutions involving the use of virtual learning, videoconferencing, social media 
      and telemedicine could effectively tackle the sudden cease in medical education. 
      Furthermore, trainee's mental health should be safeguarded, and medical students 
      can be involved in the COVID-19 clinical treatment if needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the first randomized controlled trial to investigate if 
      immersive virtual reality (VR) treatment can reduce patient perceptions of 
      anxiety compared with a tablet-based control treatment in adults undergoing a 
      first-time sternotomy. METHODS: Twenty first-time sternotomy patients were 
      prospectively randomized (blinded to investigator) to a control or VR 
      intervention. The VR intervention was a game module "Bear Blast" (AppliedVR) 
      displayed using a Samsung Gear Oculus VR headset. The control intervention was a 
      tablet-based game with comparable audio, visual, and tactile components. The 
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was administered before and after the assigned 
      intervention. Self-reported anxiety measures between the control and VR groups 
      were evaluated using an unpaired t test. Changes in self-reported anxiety 
      measures pre- and post-intervention were evaluated with a paired t test for both 
      the control and VR groups. The study took place from May 1, 2017, through January 
      1, 2019 (Institutional Review Board 16-009784). RESULTS: Both control and VR 
      groups were 90.0% male, with a mean ± SD age of 63.4 ± 9.11 and 69.5 ± 6.9 years, 
      respectively. VR users experienced significant reductions in feeling tense and 
      strained, and significant improvements in feeling calm when compared with tablet 
      controls (P<0.05). They also experienced significant reductions in feeling 
      strained, upset, and tense when compared with their own self-reported anxiety 
      measure pre- and post-intervention (P<0.05). Critically, control patients had no 
      change in these categories. CONCLUSION: Immersive VR is an effective, 
      nonpharmacologic approach to reducing preoperative anxiety in adults undergoing 
      cardiac surgery and shows the validity and utility of this technology in adult 
      patients.

TI  - The Use of Immersive and Virtual Reality Technologies to Enable Nursing Students 
      to Experience Scenario-Based, Basic Life Support Training-Exploring the Impact on 
      Confidence and Skills.
PG  - 281-293
LID - 10.1097/CIN.0000000000000608 [doi]
AB  - The link between effective basic life support and survival following cardiac 
      arrest is well known. Nurses are often first responders at in-hospital cardiac 
      arrests and receive annual basic life support training to ensure they have the 
      adequate skills, and student nurses are taught this in preparation for their 
      clinical practice. However, it is clear that some nurses still lack confidence 
      and skills to perform basic life support in an emergency situation. This 
      innovative study included 209 participants, used a mixed-methods approach, and 
      examined three environments to compare confidence and skills in basic life 
      support training. The environments were nonimmersive (basic skills room), 
      immersive (immersive room with video technology), and the Octave (mixed reality 
      facility). The skills were measured using a Laerdal training manikin (QCPR 
      manikin), with data recorded on a wireless Laerdal Simpad, and confidence levels 
      before and after training were measured using a questionnaire. The nonimmersive 
      and the immersive rooms were familiar environments, and the students felt more 
      comfortable, relaxed, and, thus, more confident. The Octave offered the higher 
      level of simulation utilizing virtual reality technology. Students felt less 
      comfortable and less confident in the Octave; we assert that this was because the 
      environment was unfamiliar. The study identified that placing students in an 
      unfamiliar environment influences the confidence and skills associated with basic 
      life support; this could be used as a way of preparing student nurses with the 
      necessary emotional resilience to cope in stressful situations.

TI  - Simulation-based surgical education in cardiothoracic training.
PG  - 978-983
LID - 10.1111/ans.15593 [doi]
AB  - Simulation has emerged as a feasible adjunct to surgical education and training 
      for most specialties. It provides trainees with an immersive, realistic way to 
      learn a variety of skills in a safe environment with the end goal of improving 
      patient safety. There are three broad types of simulators: full mannequin 
      simulators, part-task trainers or bench models and virtual reality systems. This 
      review aims to describe the current use of simulation in cardiothoracic surgical 
      education and training. We identified multiple procedures that can be simulated 
      in cardiothoracic surgery using a combination of the above simulators, 
      three-dimensional printing and computer-based simulation. All studies that 
      assessed the efficacy of simulators showed that simulation enhances learning and 
      trainee performance allowing for repetitive training until the acquisition of 
      competence but further research into how it translates into the operating theatre 
      is required. In Australia, cardiac surgery simulation is not yet part of the 
      training curricula, but simulators are available for certain tasks and 
      procedures.

AB  - AIMS: Pacing/cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implant training currently 
      lacks a common system to objectively assess trainee ability to perform required 
      tasks at predetermined performance levels. The purpose of this study was to 
      primarily examine construct validity and reliability, secondarily discriminative 
      validity of novel intraoperative performance metrics, developed for a reference 
      approach to training novice CRT implanters. METHODS: Fifteen novice and eleven 
      experienced CRT implanters performed a 3-lead implant procedure on a virtual 
      reality simulator. Performances were video-recorded, then independently scored 
      using predefined metrics endorsed by an international panel of experts. First, 
      Novice and Experienced group scores were compared for steps completed and errors 
      made. Secondly, each group was split in two around the median score of the group 
      and subgroup scores were compared. RESULTS: The mean number of scored metrics per 
      performance was 108 and the inter-rater reliability for scoring was 0.947. 
      Compared with novices, experienced implanters completed more procedural Steps 
      correctly (mean 87% vs. 73%, p = 0.001), made fewer procedural Errors (6.3 vs. 
      11.2, p = 0.005), Critical Errors (1.8 vs. 4.4, p = 0.004), and total errors (8.1 
      vs. 15.6, p = 0.002). Furthermore, the differences between the two Novice 
      subgroups were 25% for steps completed correctly and 94% for total errors made 
      (p < 0.001); the differences between the two Experienced subgroups were 
      respectively 16% and 191% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The procedure metrics used in 
      this study reliably distinguish novice and experienced CRT implanters' 
      performances. The metrics further differentiated performance levels within a 
      group with similar experience. These performance metrics will underpin 
      quality-assured novice implanter training.

TI  - Feasibility and Tolerability of a Culture-Based Virtual Reality (VR) Training 
      Program in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Pilot 
      Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17093030 [doi]
LID - 3030
AB  - The present study examined whether a culture-based virtual reality (VR) training 
      program is feasible and tolerable for patients with amnestic mild cognitive 
      impairment (aMCI), and whether it could improve cognitive function in these 
      patients. Twenty-one outpatients with aMCI were randomized to either the VR-based 
      training group or the control group in a 1∶1 ratio. The VR-based training group 
      participated in training for 30 min/day, two days/week, for three months (24 
      times). The VR-based program was designed based on Korean traditional culture and 
      used attention, processing speed, executive function and memory conditions to 
      stimulate cognitive function. The adherence to the culture-based VR training 
      program was 91.55% ± 6.41% in the VR group. The only adverse events observed in 
      the VR group were dizziness (4.2%) and fatigue (8.3%). Analysis revealed that the 
      VR-based training group exhibited no significant differences following the 
      three-month VR program in Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) scores, 
      working memory functions such as performance on the digit span test, or in Stroop 
      test performance and word fluency. We conclude that although the 12-week 
      culture-based VR training program did not improve cognitive function, our 
      findings revealed that the culture-based VR training program was feasible and 
      tolerable for participants with aMCI.

TI  - A Psychophysiological Model of Firearms Training in Police Officers: A Virtual 
      Reality Experiment for Biocybernetic Adaptation.

AB  - Crucial elements for police firearms training include mastering very specific 
      psychophysiological responses associated with controlled breathing while 
      shooting. Under high-stress situations, the shooter is affected by responses of 
      the sympathetic nervous system that can impact respiration. This research focuses 
      on how frontal oscillatory brainwaves and cardiovascular responses of trained 
      police officers (N = 10) are affected during a virtual reality (VR) firearms 
      training routine. We present data from an experimental study wherein shooters 
      were interacting in a VR-based training simulator designed to elicit 
      psychophysiological changes under easy, moderate and frustrating difficulties. 
      Outcome measures in this experiment include electroencephalographic and heart 
      rate variability (HRV) parameters, as well as performance metrics from the VR 
      simulator. Results revealed that specific frontal areas of the brain elicited 
      different responses during resting states when compared with active shooting in 
      the VR simulator. Moreover, sympathetic signatures were found in the HRV 
      parameters (both time and frequency) reflecting similar differences. Based on the 
      experimental findings, we propose a psychophysiological model to aid the design 
      of a biocybernetic adaptation layer that creates real-time modulations in 
      simulation difficulty based on targeted physiological responses.

TI  - Can hypnosis and virtual reality reduce anxiety, pain and fatigue among patients 
      who undergo cardiac surgery: a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 330
LID - 10.1186/s13063-020-4222-6 [doi]
LID - 330
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different non-pharmacological techniques, including hypnosis and 
      virtual reality (VR) are currently used as complementary tools in the treatment 
      of anxiety, acute and chronic pain. A new technique called virtual reality 
      hypnosis (VRH), which encompasses a combination of both tools, is regularly used 
      although its benefits and underlying mechanisms remain unknown to date. With the 
      goal to improve our understanding of VRH combination effects, it is necessary to 
      conduct randomised and controlled research trials in order to understand their 
      clinical interest and potential benefits. METHODS: Patients (n = 100) undergoing 
      cardiac surgery at the Liège University Hospital will be randomly assigned to one 
      of four conditions (control, hypnosis, VR or VRH). Each patient will receive two 
      sessions of one of the techniques: one the day before the surgery and one the day 
      after. Physiological assessments will be made on the monitor and patients will 
      rate their levels of anxiety, fatigue, pain, absorption and dissociation. 
      DISCUSSION: This study will help to expand knowledge on the application of 
      virtual reality, hypnosis and VRH in the specific context of cardiac and 
      intensive care procedures, and the influence of these non-pharmacological 
      techniques on patient's anxiety, fatigue, pain and phenomenological experience.

      Older People: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 93

LID - 93
AB  - Aging is a condition that may be characterized by a decline in physical, sensory, 
      and mental capacities, while increased morbidity and multimorbidity may be 
      associated with disability. A wide range of clinical conditions (e.g., frailty, 
      mild cognitive impairment, metabolic syndrome) and age-related diseases (e.g., 
      Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, cancer, sarcopenia, cardiovascular and 
      respiratory diseases) affect older people. Virtual reality (VR) is a novel and 
      promising tool for assessment and rehabilitation in older people. Usability is a 
      crucial factor that must be considered when designing virtual systems for 
      medicine. We conducted a systematic review with Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines concerning the usability 
      of VR clinical systems in aging and provided suggestions to structure usability 
      piloting. Findings show that different populations of older people have been 
      recruited to mainly assess usability of non-immersive VR, with particular 
      attention paid to motor/physical rehabilitation. Mixed approach (qualitative and 
      quantitative tools together) is the preferred methodology; technology acceptance 
      models are the most applied theoretical frameworks, however senior adapted models 
      are the best within this context. Despite minor interaction issues and bugs, 
      virtual systems are rated as usable and feasible. We encourage usability and user 
      experience pilot studies to ameliorate interaction and improve acceptance and use 
      of VR clinical applications in older people with the aid of suggestions (VR-USOP) 
      provided by our analysis.

AB  - The future of emergency medicine is determined by technical innovations. Besides 
      virtual reality in education and training, the detection of a deteriorating 
      patient and a cardiac arrest will become digital. The biggest milestone will be 
      the individualized cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Maybe in future virtual 
      intelligence will determine the CPR workflow more than standardized algorithm.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the acute hemodynamic effects of adding virtual 
      reality-based therapy (VRBT) using exergames for patients undergoing cardiac 
      rehabilitation (CR). DESIGN: Crossover trial. SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation 
      center. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=27) with a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease 
      or cardiovascular risk factors. Mean age (years) ± SD was 63.4±12.7 and mean body 
      mass index (kg/m2) ± SD was 29.0±4.0. INTERVENTIONS: Patients performed 1 VRBT 
      session and 1 CR session on 2 nonconsecutive days. Each session comprised an 
      initial rest, warm-up, conditioning, and recovery. During warm-up, in the VRBT 
      session, games were performed with sensors to reproduce the movements of avatars 
      and, in the CR session, patients were required to reproduce the movements of the 
      physiotherapists. In the conditioning phase for VRBT, games were also played with 
      motion sensors, dumbbells, and shin guards. The CR session consisted of exercises 
      performed on a treadmill. The intensity of training was prescribed by heart rate 
      reserve (HRR; 40%-70%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were heart 
      rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate (RR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), 
      and peripheral oxygen saturation, evaluated before, during, and after the VRBT or 
      CR session on 2 nonconsecutive days. The secondary outcome was to evaluate 
      whether the patients achieved the prescribed HRR and the percentage of time they 
      maintained this level during the VRBT session. RESULTS: VRBT produces a 
      physiological similar pattern of acute hemodynamic effects in CR. However, there 
      was greater magnitude of heart rate, RR, and RPE (P<.01) during the execution of 
      VRBT and until 5 minutes of recovery, observed at the moments of rest, and 1, 3, 
      and 5 minutes of recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Although the VRBT session produces 
      similar physiological acute hemodynamic effects in CR, greater magnitudes of 
      heart rate, RR, and RPE were observed during its execution and up to 5 minutes 
      after the session.

AB  - Recent miniaturization of electronic components and advances in image processing 
      software have facilitated the entry of extended reality technology into clinical 
      practice. In the last several years, the number of applications in cardiology has 
      multiplied, with many promising to become standard of care. We review many of 
      these applications in the areas of patient and physician education, cardiac 
      rehabilitation, pre-procedural planning and intraprocedural use. The rapid 
      integration of these approaches into the many facets of cardiology suggests that 
      they will one day become an every-day part of physician practice.

TI  - Utilization of a Voice-Based Virtual Reality Advanced Cardiac Life Support Team 
      Leader Refresher: Prospective Observational Study.
PG  - e17425
LID - 10.2196/17425 [doi]
LID - e17425
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of cardiac arrests per year in the United States 
      continues to increase, yet in-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates 
      significantly vary between hospitals. Current methods of training are expensive, 
      time consuming, and difficult to scale, which necessitates improvements in 
      advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) training. Virtual reality (VR) has been 
      proposed as an alternative or adjunct to high-fidelity simulation (HFS) in 
      several environments. No evaluations to date have explored the ability of a VR 
      program to examine both technical and behavioral skills and demonstrate a cost 
      comparison. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the utility of a voice-based 
      VR ACLS team leader refresher as compared with HFS. METHODS: This prospective 
      observational study performed at an academic institution consisted of 25 
      postgraduate year 2 residents. Participants were randomized to HFS or VR training 
      and then crossed groups after a 2-week washout. Participants were graded on 
      technical and nontechnical skills. Participants also completed self-assessments 
      about the modules. Proctors were assessed for fatigue and task saturation, and 
      cost analysis based on local economic data was performed. RESULTS: A total of 23 
      of 25 participants were included in the scoring analysis. Fewer participants were 
      familiar with VR compared with HFS (9/25, 36% vs 25/25, 100%; P<.001). 
      Self-reported satisfaction and utilization scores were similar; however, 
      significantly more participants felt HFS provided better feedback: 99 (IQR 
      89-100) vs 79 (IQR 71-88); P<.001. Technical scores were higher in the HFS group; 
      however, nontechnical scores for decision making and communication were not 
      significantly different between modalities. VR sessions were 21 (IQR 19-24) min 
      shorter than HFS sessions, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration task 
      load index scores for proctors were lower in each category, and VR sessions were 
      estimated to be US $103.68 less expensive in a single-learner, single-session 
      model. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of a VR-based team leader refresher for ACLS 
      skills is comparable with HFS in several areas, including learner satisfaction. 
      The VR module was more cost-effective and was easier to proctor; however, HFS was 
      better at delivering feedback to participants. Optimal education strategies 
      likely contain elements of both modalities. Further studies are needed to examine 
      the utility of VR-based environments at scale.

TI  - The role of virtual reality on outcomes in rehabilitation of Parkinson's disease: 
      meta-analysis and systematic review in 1031 participants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is managed primarily by dopamine agonists 
      and physiotherapy while virtual reality (VR) has emerged recently as a 
      complementary method. The present study reviewed the effectiveness of VR in 
      rehabilitation of patients with PD. METHODS: Literature search up to June 2019 
      identified ten studies (n = 343 participants) suitable for meta-analysis and 27 
      studies (n = 688 participants) for systematic review. Standard mean difference 
      (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects 
      model. RESULTS: In meta-analysis, compared with active rehabilitation 
      intervention, VR training led to greater improvement of stride length, SMD = 0.70 
      (95%CI = 0.32-1.08, p = 0.0003), and was as effective for gait speed, balance and 
      co-ordination, cognitive function and mental health, quality of life and 
      activities of daily living. Compared with passive rehabilitation intervention, VR 
      had greater effects on balance: SMD = 1.02 (95%CI = 0.38-1.65, p = 0.002). 
      Results from single randomised controlled trials showed that VR training was 
      better than passive rehabilitation intervention for improving gait speed SMD = 
      1.43 (95%CI = 0.51-2.34, p = 0.002), stride length SMD = 1.27 (95%CI = 0.38-2.16, 
      p = 0.005) and activities of daily living SMD = 0.96 (95%CI = 0.02-1.89). 
      Systematic review showed that VR training significantly (p < 0.05) improved motor 
      function, balance and co-ordination, cognitive function and mental health, and 
      quality of life and activities of daily living. CONCLUSION: VR used in 
      rehabilitation for patients with PD improves a number of outcomes and may be 
      considered for routine use in rehabilitation.

TI  - Effect of Face-to-Face vs Virtual Reality Training on Cardiopulmonary 
      Resuscitation Quality: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 328-335
LID - 10.1001/jamacardio.2019.4992 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is crucial for survival 
      after cardiac arrest but not performed in most cases. New, low-cost, and easily 
      accessible training methods, such as virtual reality (VR), may reach broader 
      target populations, but data on achieved CPR skills are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To 
      compare CPR quality between VR and face-to-face CPR training. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized noninferiority trial with a prospective randomized 
      open blinded end point design. Participants were adult attendees from the science 
      section of the Lowlands Music Festival (August 16 to 18, 2019) in the 
      Netherlands. Analysis began September 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Two standardized 
      20-minute protocols on CPR and automated external defibrillator use: 
      instructor-led face-to-face training or VR training using a smartphone app 
      endorsed by the Resuscitation Council (United Kingdom). MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: During a standardized CPR scenario following the training, we assessed 
      the primary outcome CPR quality, measured as chest compression depth and rate 
      using CPR manikins. Overall CPR performance was assessed by examiners, blinded 
      for study groups, using a European Resuscitation Council-endorsed checklist 
      (maximum score, 13). Additional secondary outcomes were chest compression 
      fraction, proportions of participants with mean depth (50 mm-60 mm) or rate (100 
      min-1-120 min-1) within guideline ranges, and proportions compressions with full 
      release. RESULTS: A total of 381 participants were randomized: 216 women (57%); 
      median (interquartile range [IQR]) age, 26 (22-31) years. The VR app (n = 190 
      [49.9%]) was inferior to face-to-face training (n = 191 [50.1%]) for chest 
      compression depth (mean [SD], VR: 49 [10] mm vs face to face: 57 [5] mm; mean 
      [95% CI] difference, -8 [-9 to -6] mm), and noninferior for chest compression 
      rate (mean [SD]: VR: 114 [12] min-1 vs face to face: 109 [12] min-1; mean [95% 
      CI] difference, 6 [3 to 8] min-1). The VR group had lower overall CPR performance 
      scores (median [IQR], 10 [8-12] vs 12 [12-13]; P < .001). Chest compression 
      fraction (median [IQR], 61% [52%-66%] vs 67% [62%-71%]; P < .001) and proportions 
      of participants fulfilling depth (51% [n = 89] vs 75% [n = 133], P < .001) and 
      rate (50% [n = 87] vs 63% [n = 111], P = .01) requirements were also lower in the 
      VR group. The proportion of compressions with full release was higher in the VR 
      group (median [IQR], 98% [59%-100%] vs 88% [55%-99%]; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: In this randomized noninferiority trial, VR training resulted in 
      comparable chest compression rate but inferior compression depth compared with 
      face-to-face training. Given the potential of VR training to reach a larger 
      target population, further development is needed to achieve the compression depth 
      and overall CPR skills acquired by face-to-face training. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04013633.

TI  - Virtual-Reality Guided Versus Fluoroscopy-Guided Transseptal Puncture in a 
      Cardiac Phantom.
PG  - 76-81
LID - JIC20200120-1 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We compared virtual-reality guided versus fluoroscopy-guided 
      transseptal puncture by novice and experienced operators in a cardiac phantom. 
      Outcome measures included accuracy, time, transseptal path distance, and a survey 
      of the operator experience. METHODS: A transseptal simulator was created using a 
      Plexiglas case and a 3D-printed cardiac phantom with a replaceable fossa ovalis, 
      a customized support, and an electromagnetic tracking system. A precisely 
      registered virtual-reality rendering was constructed. To display the transseptal 
      instruments in virtual reality, we attached electromagnetic sensors to standard 
      transseptal instruments, including the needle, dilator, and sheath. Each subject 
      completed 6 simulated transseptal punctures (3 fluoroscopy-guided and 3 
      virtual-reality guided). We measured the distance traversed by the transseptal 
      needle, accuracy, and time for each simulated transseptal puncture. Operators 
      were then surveyed regarding their experience. RESULTS: A total of 8 subjects (6 
      faculty, 2 fellows) completed the trial. We found that virtual-reality guidance 
      resulted in significantly more accurate puncture site selection and, 
      subjectively, was more intuitive for the operator, particularly for novices. None 
      of the participants experienced negative symptoms in virtual reality that 
      required cessation of the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality compared with 
      fluoroscopic guidance for transseptal puncture shows considerable promise, 
      particularly for novice trainees, where it could lessen the learning curve. 
      Current barriers to widespread implementation are discussed.

LID - 10.1259/bjr.20190701 [doi]
LID - 20190701
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate accuracy of virtual-non-contrast images (VNC) compared to 
      true-unenhanced-images (TNC) for evaluation of liver attenuation acquired using 
      spectral-detector CT (SDCT). METHODS: 149 patients who underwent multiphase 
      transcatheter-aortic-valve-replacement (TAVR) SDCT-examinations [unenhanced-chest 
      (TNC), CT-angiography chest (CTA-chest, early arterial-phase) and abdomen 
      (CTA-abdomen, additional early arterial-phase after a second injection of 
      contrast media)] were retrospectively included. VNC of CTA-chest (VNC-chest) and 
      CTA-abdomen (VNC-abdomen) were reconstructed and compared to TNC. Region of 
      interest-based measurement of mean attenuation (Hounsfield unit, HU) was applied 
      in the following regions: liver, spleen, abdominal aorta and paraspinal muscle. 
      RESULTS: VNC accuracy was high in the liver, spleen, abdominal aorta and muscle 
      for abdomen-scanning. For the liver, average attenuation was 59.0 ± 9.1 HU for 
      TNC and 72.6 ± 9.5 HU for CTA-abdomen. Liver attenuation in VNC-abdomen (59.1 ± 
      6.4 HU) was not significantly different from attenuation in TNC (p > 0.05). In 
      contrast, VNC was less accurate for chest-scanning: Due to the protocol, in 
      CTA-chest no contrast media was present in the liver parenchyma as indicated by 
      the same attenuation in TNC (59.0 ± 9.1 HU) and CTA-chest (58.8 ± 8.9 HU, p > 
      0.05). Liver attenuation in VNC-chest (56.2 ± 6.4 HU, p < 0.05) was, however, 
      significantly lower than in TNC and CTA-chest implying an artificial reduction of 
      attenuation. CONCLUSION: VNC performed well in a large cohort of 
      TAVR-examinations yielding equivalent mean attenuations to TNC; however, 
      application of this technique might be limited when no or very little contrast 
      media is present in parenchyma, more precisely in an early arterial-phase of the 
      liver. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study showed that VNC can be reliably applied 
      in cardiac protocols when certain limitations are considered.

TI  - The Impact of Exposure Therapy on Resting Heart Rate and Heart Rate Reactivity 
      Among Active-Duty Soldiers With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
PG  - 108-114
LID - 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000758 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is linked to poor health, 
      including cardiovascular disease. These effects may be a result of increased 
      tonic cardiovascular function and cardiovascular reactivity. Despite PTSD's 
      negative health burden, relatively little is known about whether frontline 
      treatments for PTSD may alleviate cardiovascular risk. METHODS: The current study 
      was a secondary analysis of a larger intervention study of active-duty soldiers 
      with PTSD (n = 104; mean [SD] age = 30.6 [6.7] years; 6% women) randomized to an 
      exposure therapy-either prolonged exposure (PE) or virtual reality exposure 
      (VRE)-or a waitlist control condition. We examined change in participants' 
      resting heart rate (HR) and HR reactivity from baseline (before randomization) to 
      midtreatment and posttreatment using residualized change regression models. 
      RESULTS: The results of the study demonstrated decreased resting HR (B = -5.06, p 
      = .024) and HR reactivity (B = -2.46, p = .005) from baseline to posttreatment of 
      PE and VRE relative to waitlist. Exploratory analyses found that changes in 
      resting HR and HR reactivity were not significantly correlated with either 
      self-reported or clinician-rated PTSD symptom change. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      suggest that PE and VRE for PTSD may alleviate some cardiovascular health risk 
      associated with PTSD, improving cardiovascular functioning.RCT Registration:

TI  - Clinical Practice Guideline to Improve Locomotor Function Following Chronic 
      Stroke, Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury, and Brain Injury.
PG  - 49-100
LID - 10.1097/NPT.0000000000000303 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with acute-onset central nervous system (CNS) injury, 
      including stroke, motor incomplete spinal cord injury, or traumatic brain injury, 
      often experience lasting locomotor deficits, as quantified by decreases in gait 
      speed and distance walked over a specific duration (timed distance). The goal of 
      the present clinical practice guideline was to delineate the relative efficacy of 
      various interventions to improve walking speed and timed distance in ambulatory 
      individuals greater than 6 months following these specific diagnoses. METHODS: A 
      systematic review of the literature published between 1995 and 2016 was performed 
      in 4 databases for randomized controlled clinical trials focused on these 
      specific patient populations, at least 6 months postinjury and with specific 
      outcomes of walking speed and timed distance. For all studies, specific 
      parameters of training interventions including frequency, intensity, time, and 
      type were detailed as possible. Recommendations were determined on the basis of 
      the strength of the evidence and the potential harm, risks, or costs of providing 
      a specific training paradigm, particularly when another intervention may be 
      available and can provide greater benefit. RESULTS: Strong evidence indicates 
      that clinicians should offer walking training at moderate to high intensities or 
      virtual reality-based training to ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months 
      following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance. In 
      contrast, weak evidence suggests that strength training, circuit (ie, combined) 
      training or cycling training at moderate to high intensities, and virtual 
      reality-based balance training may improve walking speed and distance in these 
      patient groups. Finally, strong evidence suggests that body weight-supported 
      treadmill training, robotic-assisted training, or sitting/standing balance 
      training without virtual reality should not be performed to improve walking speed 
      or distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset 
      CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance. DISCUSSION: The collective 
      findings suggest that large amounts of task-specific (ie, locomotor) practice may 
      be critical for improvements in walking function, although only at higher 
      cardiovascular intensities or with augmented feedback to increase patient's 
      engagement. Lower-intensity walking interventions or impairment-based training 
      strategies demonstrated equivocal or limited efficacy. LIMITATIONS: As walking 
      speed and distance were primary outcomes, the research participants included in 
      the studies walked without substantial physical assistance. This guideline may 
      not apply to patients with limited ambulatory function, where provision of 
      walking training may require substantial physical assistance. SUMMARY: The 
      guideline suggests that task-specific walking training should be performed to 
      improve walking speed and distance in those with acute-onset CNS injury although 
      only at higher intensities or with augmented feedback. Future studies should 
      clarify the potential utility of specific training parameters that lead to 
      improved walking speed and distance in these populations in both chronic and 
      subacute stages following injury. DISCLAIMER: These recommendations are intended 
      as a guide for clinicians to optimize rehabilitation outcomes for persons with 
      chronic stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury to 
      improve walking speed and distance.

TI  - Virtual reality in pediatric cardiology: hype or hope for the future?
PG  - 37-41
LID - 10.1097/HCO.0000000000000694 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the field of pediatric cardiology, a sub-specialty that 
      relies on an understanding of complex three-dimensional structures, virtual 
      reality technology may represent a new and exciting tool for both practitioners 
      and patients. Here, the current medical and surgical applications of virtual 
      reality are reviewed and the potential for future applications explored. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Multiple centers have begun to develop software designed to bring 
      virtual reality technology to bear on congenital heart disease. These efforts 
      have focused on surgical preparation, on education of medical providers, and on 
      preparation of patients and their family members for cardiac interventions. 
      Though relatively little statistical evidence for benefit has been generated to 
      date, those studies currently available suggest that virtual reality may provide 
      a significant benefit in all three of these aspects of medical care. SUMMARY: The 
      immersive nature of virtual reality meshes well with the learning styles of adult 
      practitioners and promises to be a powerful tool for both pediatric cardiologists 
      and the patients with whose care they are entrusted. Though additional studies 
      are clearly needed, this technology promises to improve the field's ability to 
      prepare providers and patients alike for challenge of treating congenital heart 
      disease.

TI  - Does virtual reality reduce pain in pediatric patients? A systematic review.
PG  - 171
LID - 10.1186/s13052-019-0757-0 [doi]
LID - 171
AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) as a tool for pain reduction is the research topic of 
      several clinical trial for Randomized Controlled Trials despite its wide use in 
      the daily clinical practice for non- pharmacological reduction of pain in some 
      countries. At present, there are no published reviews of VR-efficacy of pain 
      reduction in pediatric patients. That is why we made a systematic review of the 
      efficacy of VR as a tool for pain reduction in children and adolescents. 
      Electronic databases and gray literature published between 2014 and 2019 were 
      analyzed. A total of 9 studies were eligible according to the established 
      inclusion criteria. Results show that virtual reality is a valid tool for 
      non-pharmacological pain reduction and that this approach is to be preferred to 
      the standard reduction techniques currently in use. However, more studies using 
      standardized experimental methodologies are needed to provide more systematic 
      comparison and quantitative synthesis.

PG  - 491

AB  - BACKGROUND: Earlier studies evaluated the physiological responses to video games 
      in children with different clinical conditions; however, no study has compared 
      active video games with an incremental field test in healthy children. The 
      purpose of this study was to verify the agreement between the 20-m shuttle run 
      test (20 m-SRT) and virtual system (VS). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study 
      of 235 children (9.0 ± 0.8 years, 109 boys). The two tests were performed one 
      week apart and the children were instructed not to engage in any physical 
      exercise or sports in the 24 h preceding each test. Their resting heart rate was 
      monitored for one minute and then throughout the tests. To evaluate the influence 
      of motivation on the 20 m SRT and (VS), at the end of the tests the children were 
      asked to rate their motivation on a scale of zero to 10, zero being "not cool" 
      and 10 "awesome". Perceived exertion at the end of the tests was assessed using 
      the modified Borg scale. RESULTS: Maximum heart rate (HRmax) did not differ 
      between the 20 m-SRT and VS (194.4 ± 10.2 bpm vs. 193.2 ± 13.8 bpm, 
      respectively). Both tests were similar for intensity > and < 96% HRmax. The 
      children showed greater exertion on the Borg scale and motivation during the VS. 
      The multiple logistic regression model showed that motivation (p = 0.98), sex 
      (p = 0.53), age (p = 0.61), nutritional status (p = 0.65), and speed (p = 0.18) 
      were not predictive factors of the child's reaching HRmax. CONCLUSION: VS can be 
      used as a tool to evaluate the intensity of maximal exercise tests, given that 
      the percentage of children who achieved HRmax did not differ between the VS and 
      20 m SRT. The perceived exertion scales were correlated, but only the modified 
      Borg scale correlated with HRmax in the 20 m SRT. The tests are motivational, and 
      most children obtained the maximum VS score.

TI  - Perception and Performance on a Virtual Reality Cognitive Stimulation for Use in 
      the Intensive Care Unit: A Non-randomized Trial in Critically Ill Patients.

AB  - Background: Newly acquired long-term cognitive impairments are common among 
      survivors of critical illness. They have been linked to the stressful situation 
      that patients experience in the intensive care unit (ICU). In this paper we use 
      virtual reality (VR) technology to comfort critically ill patients and reduce 
      stress during their ICU stay. We investigate the acceptance, comfort, 
      recollection, and visual perception of VR stimulation and how it affects 
      physiological parameters. Methods: A VR head-mounted display was used to present 
      immersive nature scenes to 33 critically ill cardiac surgery patients [mean age 
      63 years (range 32-83)]. Data was collected with an eye tracker fitted inside the 
      VR head-mounted display to measure eye movements (250 Hz) and sensors to record 
      physiological parameters (240 Hz). Patients received VR stimulation (for 5 min.) 
      prior to ICU admission, during ICU stay, and 3 months after discharge. 
      Acceptance, recollection and comfort were assessed with validated questionnaires. 
      Results: The number of gazed meaningful objects per minute was significantly 
      lower during the ICU session compared to pre- and follow-up sessions, whereas 
      mean duration of fixation on meaningful moving objects did not differ between the 
      sessions. While respiratory rate decreased significantly during VR stimulation, 
      heart rate and blood pressure remained constant. Post-ICU rating of VR acceptance 
      during ICU stay was moderate to high and discomfort low. Recollection of VR was 
      high [28/33 patients (84.8%)], while recollection of ICU stay was low [10/33 
      patients (30.3%)]. Conclusion: Eye movements indicate that patients were able to 
      perceive and process cognitive stimulation during their ICU stay. VR was recalled 
      better than the rest of the ICU stay and well accepted. Decreased respiratory 
      rate during stimulation indicate a relaxing effect of VR.

AB  - The history of congenital interventional cardiology has seen numerous 
      groundbreaking innovations typically related to the introduction of a new device 
      or a novel treatment technique. Similarly, imaging of cardiac defects has changed 
      dramatically over the past decades, although some of the advancements have seemed 
      to omit the catheterisation laboratories. Rotational angiography, one of the 
      imaging techniques for guidance of cardiac catheterisation currently referred to 
      as "advanced", in fact was described already in 1960s.1 More recently its 
      improved version, including three-dimensional reconstruction (3DRA), became a 
      valuable intra-procedural imaging tool in interventional cardiology and 
      neuroradiology.2 Dr Evan Zahn was one of the pioneers of 3DRA in the field of 
      congenital cardiology, setting an example for many to follow. With his innovative 
      publication and subsequent lecture at 2011 Pediatric and Adult Interventional 
      Cardiac Symposium (PICS-AICS) on "The Emerging Use of 3-Dimensional Rotational 
      Angiography in Congenital Heart Disease" he motivated many to explore benefits of 
      this modality to strive for improved procedural outcomes and reduced patients' 
      burden of cardiac catheterisation3. I was one of those to take Dr Zahn's thoughts 
      and implement them into routine workflow.4-6 However, almost a decade after Dr 
      Zahn shared his important work, despite tremendous efforts by teams from Utrecht, 
      (Netherlands) and Columbus (Ohio, United States of America) to popularise 3D 
      imaging in catheterisation laboratory during dedicated meetings, two-dimensional 
      (2D) angiography does not seem to be threatened in many, otherwise-progressive, 
      laboratories. During the recent 30th Japanese Pediatric Interventional Cardiology 
      (JPIC) meeting I had the opportunity to ask Dr Zahn why giving up knowledge is 
      almost never a good idea, what is technology's natural order of things, and why 
      the technology has to be more than just exciting, pretty, and new.

PG  - 1327-1332
LID - 10.1177/0954411919878067 [doi]
AB  - We describe the use of virtual reality technology for surgical planning in the 
      successful separation of thoracopagus conjoined twins. Three-dimensional models 
      were created from computed tomography angiograms to simulate the patient's 
      anatomy on a virtual stereoscopic display. Members of the surgical teams reviewed 
      the anatomical models to localize an interatrial communication that allowed blood 
      to flow between the two hearts. The surgical plan to close the 1-mm interatrial 
      communication was significantly modified based on the pre-procedural spatial 
      awareness of the anatomy presented in the virtual visualization. The virtual 
      stereoscopic display was critical for the surgical team to successfully separate 
      the twins and provides a useful case study for the use of virtual reality 
      technology in surgical planning. Both twins survived the operation and were 
      subsequently discharged from the hospital.

TI  - Patient-Specific Rehearsal Feasibility Before Endovascular Repair of Ruptured 
      Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.
PG  - 871-878
LID - 10.1177/1526602819873133 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of a patient-specific rehearsal (PsR) before 
      emergency endovascular aneurysm repairs (eEVAR) and its influence on the 
      operation. Materials and Methods: From February 2016 to October 2016, 10 
      consecutive patients (mean age 75±7.4 years; 9 men) presenting with a ruptured 
      abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) suitable for standard EVAR were enrolled in the 
      study. A 3-dimensional (3D) model of the abdominal aorta was generated on a 
      virtual reality simulator based on the patient's computed tomography (CT) images. 
      Following the patient-specific simulation setup, PsR was conducted during patient 
      admission or in parallel with the preoperative eEVAR workup. Measured outcomes 
      were PsR feasibility only in the first 4 patients and impact on operative 
      performance thereafter (changes in device selection, the planning process, 
      clinical outcomes, perioperative mortality, and complication rates). Technical 
      metrics and timing of system setup, rehearsal, interval from patient arrival to 
      the actual procedure, and eEVAR were recorded. Results: Mean time for 3D model 
      creation was 21.3±7.8 minutes (range 13-37); there was a significant positive 
      relationship between aortic neck diameter and segmentation time (p=0.003). The 
      overall mean time for simulator setup and PsR was 54±14 minutes (range 37-80); 
      PsR alone was completed in a mean 31±40 minutes (95% confidence interval -60 to 
      -2.2). The actual eEVAR procedure duration was 69±16 minutes (range 45-90). No 
      delay in the actual eEVAR procedure was registered owing to the PsR pathway. In 6 
      patients, preprocedure rehearsal induced changes in operative strategy, including 
      device selection, main body introduction side, and/or deployment configuration. 
      In 4 cases, rehearsal was performed twice to achieve optimal performance. 
      Conclusion: PsR before eEVAR was feasible in all cases and caused no time delays 
      in the actual eEVAR procedure. PsR optimized eEVAR planning by identifying 
      optimal strategy for stent-graft component selection and deployment.

AB  - Knowledge of whole heart anatomy is a prerequisite for many clinical 
      applications. Whole heart segmentation (WHS), which delineates substructures of 
      the heart, can be very valuable for modeling and analysis of the anatomy and 
      functions of the heart. However, automating this segmentation can be challenging 
      due to the large variation of the heart shape, and different image qualities of 
      the clinical data. To achieve this goal, an initial set of training data is 
      generally needed for constructing priors or for training. Furthermore, it is 
      difficult to perform comparisons between different methods, largely due to 
      differences in the datasets and evaluation metrics used. This manuscript presents 
      the methodologies and evaluation results for the WHS algorithms selected from the 
      submissions to the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation (MM-WHS) challenge, in 
      conjunction with MICCAI 2017. The challenge provided 120 three-dimensional 
      cardiac images covering the whole heart, including 60 CT and 60 MRI volumes, all 
      acquired in clinical environments with manual delineation. Ten algorithms for CT 
      data and eleven algorithms for MRI data, submitted from twelve groups, have been 
      evaluated. The results showed that the performance of CT WHS was generally better 
      than that of MRI WHS. The segmentation of the substructures for different 
      categories of patients could present different levels of challenge due to the 
      difference in imaging and variations of heart shapes. The deep learning 
      (DL)-based methods demonstrated great potential, though several of them reported 
      poor results in the blinded evaluation. Their performance could vary greatly 
      across different network structures and training strategies. The conventional 
      algorithms, mainly based on multi-atlas segmentation, demonstrated good 
      performance, though the accuracy and computational efficiency could be limited. 
      The challenge, including provision of the annotated training data and the blinded 
      evaluation for submitted algorithms on the test data, continues as an ongoing 
      benchmarking resource via its homepage 
      (www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/mmwhs/).

TI  - Rationale and design of the Lowlands Saves Lives trial: a randomised trial to 
      compare CPR quality and long-term attitude towards CPR performance between 
      face-to-face and virtual reality training with the Lifesaver VR app.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Layperson cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a key aspect in 
      the chain of survival after cardiac arrest. New, low-cost, easily accessible 
      training methods such as virtual reality (VR) training with a smartphone 
      application may reach broader populations, but data on CPR performance are 
      scarce. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Lowlands Saves Lives trial is a prospective 
      randomised open-blinded end-point evaluation study, comparing two 20 min CPR 
      training protocols: standardised, certified instructor-led face-to-face training 
      complying with current education guidelines (using Laerdal Little Anne manikins), 
      and VR training, using the UK Resuscitation Council endorsed Lifesaver VR app. In 
      the latter, chest compressions are practiced on a pillow.During VR training, 
      participants learn to resuscitate by completing a filmed CPR scenario while 
      wearing VR goggles and headphones. Eligible for inclusion are adult attendees of 
      Lowlands Science, a specific section of the 3-day Lowlands music festival (50 000 
      attendees), dedicated exclusively to science. Following the training, all 
      participants will perform a CPR test on a Laerdal Resusci Anne QCPR manikin. 
      Primary outcome measures are depth and rate of chest compressions, measured using 
      CPR manikins. The key secondary outcome is overall CPR performance, with 
      real-time examination (blinded for study group) of all items of a European 
      Resuscitation Council endorsed checklist, and evaluation of a sample of 
      videotaped CPR tests by a blinded event committee.Given the unique setting of a 
      festival, the primary additional analysis will address the impact of alcohol 
      levels on CPR quality parameters and overall performance. Follow-up 
      questionnaires will evaluate the attitude towards performing CPR. This unique 
      study may provide important insights into innovative CPR training methods, 
      factors that impact CPR performance and the impact on long-term attitude towards 
      resuscitation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study received approval from the 
      research ethics committee of the Radboudumc. All participants will provide 
      written informed consent. The results of this study will be published in 
      peer-reviewed journals and presented at (inter)national conferences. TRIAL

TI  - Development and Initial Evaluation of a Novel, Ultraportable, Virtual Reality 
      Bronchoscopy Simulator: The Computer Airway Simulation System.
PG  - 1258-1264
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000003316 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) simulation is an effective and safe method of 
      teaching bronchoscopic skills. Few VR bronchoscopy simulators exist; all are 
      expensive. The present study aimed to describe the design, development, and 
      evaluation of a new, affordable, VR bronchoscopy simulator. METHODS: 
      Anesthesiologists and engineers collaborated to design and develop the Computer 
      Airway Simulation System (CASS), an iPad-based, high-fidelity, VR bronchoscopy 
      simulator. We describe hardware and software development, as well as the 
      technical and teaching features of the CASS. Twenty-two senior anesthesiologists 
      evaluated various aspects of the simulator (using a 5-point Likert scale) to 
      assess its face validity. RESULTS: Anesthesiologists performed a simulated 
      bronchoscopy (mouth to carina) with a median (range) procedural time of 66 
      seconds (30-96). The simulator's ease of use was rated 4.3 ± 0.8 and the 
      bronchoscope proxy's handling 4.0 ± 0.7. Criticisms included that excessive 
      system reactivity created handling difficulties. Anatomical accuracy, 
      3-dimensional bronchial segmentation, and mucosal texture were judged to be very 
      realistic. The simulator's usefulness for teaching and its educational value were 
      highly rated (4.9 ± 0.3 and 4.8 ± 0.4, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We describe 
      the design, development, and initial evaluation of the CASS-a new, ultraportable, 
      affordable, VR bronchoscopy simulator. The simulator's face validity was 
      supported by excellent assessments from senior anesthesiologists with regard to 
      anatomical realism, quality of graphics, and handling performance, even though 
      some future refinements are required. All the practitioners agreed on the 
      significant educational potential of the CASS.

LID - 1078
AB  - Frailty is a pre-clinical condition that worsens physical health and quality of 
      life. One of the most frequent symptoms of frailty is an increased risk of 
      falling. In order to reduce this risk, we propose an innovative virtual reality 
      motor rehabilitation program based on an immersive tool. All exercises will take 
      place in the CAVE, a four-screen room with a stationary bike. The protocol will 
      include two types of exercises for the improvement of balance: "Positive Bike" 
      and "Avoid the Rocks." We will choose evaluation scales related to the functional 
      aspects and subjective perception of balance. Our aim is to prove that our 
      innovative motor rehabilitation protocol is as effective as or more effective 
      than classical rehabilitation.

TI  - Real vs. immersive-virtual emotional experience: Analysis of psycho-physiological 
      patterns in a free exploration of an art museum.

LID - e0223881
AB  - Virtual reality is a powerful tool in human behaviour research. However, few 
      studies compare its capacity to evoke the same emotional responses as in real 
      scenarios. This study investigates psycho-physiological patterns evoked during 
      the free exploration of an art museum and the museum virtualized through a 3D 
      immersive virtual environment (IVE). An exploratory study involving 60 
      participants was performed, recording electroencephalographic and 
      electrocardiographic signals using wearable devices. The real vs. virtual 
      psychological comparison was performed using self-assessment emotional response 
      tests, whereas the physiological comparison was performed through Support Vector 
      Machine algorithms, endowed with an effective feature selection procedure for a 
      set of state-of-the-art metrics quantifying cardiovascular and brain linear and 
      nonlinear dynamics. We included an initial calibration phase, using standardized 
      2D and 360° emotional stimuli, to increase the accuracy of the model. The 
      self-assessments of the physical and virtual museum support the use of IVEs in 
      emotion research. The 2-class (high/low) system accuracy was 71.52% and 77.08% 
      along the arousal and valence dimension, respectively, in the physical museum, 
      and 75.00% and 71.08% in the virtual museum. The previously presented 360° 
      stimuli contributed to increasing the accuracy in the virtual museum. Also, the 
      real vs. virtual classifier accuracy was 95.27%, using only EEG mean phase 
      coherency features, which demonstrates the high involvement of brain 
      synchronization in emotional virtual reality processes. These findings provide an 
      important contribution at a methodological level and to scientific knowledge, 
      which will effectively guide future emotion elicitation and recognition systems 
      using virtual reality.

TI  - Effects of Exercise Training Combined with Virtual Reality in Functionality and 
      Health-Related Quality of Life of Patients on Hemodialysis.
PG  - 339-348

AB  - Objective: The progression of chronic kidney disease can directly affect 
      patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Exercise training is a good 
      option to reverse the impacts caused by the disease. To escape from the 
      monotonous routine and stimulate further practice, the therapist should consider 
      making physical activity more playful. Using videogames during exercise training 
      is possible to rehabilitate the patient aiming for fun beyond the organic 
      condition. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of exercise training 
      combined with Virtual Reality (VR) in functionality and HRQoL of patients on 
      hemodialysis. Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled study in which 
      control group (n = 20) maintained only hemodialysis without any physical effort 
      or intervention from the researchers and intervention group (n = 20) who 
      performed endurance and strength physical exercises in combination with VR during 
      hemodialysis for 12 weeks. All eligible patients underwent a familiarization of 
      games and were evaluated by an investigator-blind for functional capacity, 
      quality of life, and depressive symptoms. Functional capacity tests included 
      walking speed, timed up and go (TUG), and Duke Activity Status Index (DASI). To 
      evaluate a HRQoL, Kidney Disease and Quality-of-Life Short-Form (KDQOL-SF™, v. 
      1.3) was used and to investigate depressive symptoms, the Center for 
      Epidemiological Scale-Depression. Paired sample t-tests were conducted to 
      determine differences within each group. Repeated-measures analysis of variance 
      (group vs. time) was used to assess group differences in our major outcomes. The 
      level of significance was 5%. Results: The exercise improved functional capacity 
      (TUG: P = 0.002, DASI: P < 0.001) and HRQoL in physical and specific domains: 
      physical functioning (P = 0.047), role physical (P = 0.021), as well as in 
      physical composite summary (P < 0.001) and effects of kidney disease (P = 0.013). 
      There was no influence on depressive symptoms (P = 0.154). Conclusion: Physical 
      training combined with VR improved functional capacity and some quality-of-life 
      domains of hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Use of a Virtual Reality Device for Basic Life Support Training: Prototype 
      Testing and an Exploration of Users' Views and Experience.
PG  - 287-292
LID - 10.1097/SIH.0000000000000387 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation significantly 
      increases the chances of survival after a cardiac arrest. Virtual reality devices 
      allow the integration of features of real patients into training to facilitate 
      interaction and feedback, thus improving performance. However, its use as a 
      training tool remains underexplored. The aims of this study were to undertake 
      initial testing of a virtual reality basic life support prototype and to explore 
      users' views and experiences. METHODS: We recruited 23 adult staff members 
      working at a Central London University in England and exposed them to a 5-minute 
      virtual reality experience. Each participant completed a prequestionnaire and 
      postquestionnaire and took part in a focus group discussion. Quantitative data 
      were descriptively analyzed, whereas qualitative data underwent thematic 
      analysis. RESULTS: Regardless of prior experience of using virtual reality and/or 
      performing basic life support, most participants scored more than 90% for chest 
      compressions and reported an increase in confidence and competence after the 
      experience. Focus group discussions identified the following 4 key themes: 
      experience and expectations; performance and feedback; interaction and immersion; 
      and potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that virtual reality is an 
      enjoyable method by which to teach basic life support. Although concerns over the 
      accuracy of the tracking system and the small sample size weaken our conclusions 
      regarding its ability to assess performance, our exploratory data are of value to 
      educators, researchers, and policy makers. Future work needs to address our study 
      limitations, consider how virtual reality fits into the broader context of 
      training, and attend to accreditation and resource issues.

AB  - This study investigated the benefits of using a virtual nature environment to 
      administer immersive heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) based on 
      slow-paced breathing. We compared the virtual reality (VR)-based HRV-BF with a 
      standard implementation in a randomized controlled experiment with 60 healthy 
      employees. After a cognitive stress induction, the participants performed a 
      single-session of HRV-BF before repeating the cognitive stressor task. VR-based 
      versus standard HRV-BF was comparable in terms of biofeedback performance 
      (cardiac coherence and cardiac vagal tone). However, the VR-based implementation 
      buffered perceived stress in the subsequent stressor task, increased relaxation 
      self-efficacy more, reduced mind wandering, helped participants focus on the 
      present moment, and helped preserve attentional resources. Potential long-term 
      effects and generalizability need to be assessed in future research.

      Parameters: Cross-Sectional Experiment.
PG  - e12324

LID - e12324
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, many studies have associated sedentary behavior in 
      front of screens with health problems in infants, children, and adolescents. Yet 
      options for exergaming-playing video games that require rigorous physical 
      exercise-seem to fall short of the physical activity levels recommended by the 
      World Health Organization. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to 
      investigate the effect of a fully immersive virtual reality (VR)-based training 
      system on cardiovascular and muscular parameters of young adults. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional experiment design was used to analyze muscle activity (surface 
      electromyography), heart rate, perceived exertion (RPE), cybersickness symptoms, 
      perceived workload, and physical activity enjoyment (PACES) in 33 participants 
      performing two 5-minute flights on a new training device. RESULTS: Participants' 
      performance of the planking position required to play the game resulted in 
      moderate aerobic intensity (108 [SD 18.69] bpm). Due to the mainly isometric 
      contraction of the dorsal muscle chain (with a mean activation between 20.6% [SD 
      10.57] and 26.7% [SD 17.39] maximum voluntary isometric contraction), 
      participants described the exercise as a moderate to vigorous activity (RPE 14.6 
      [SD 1.82]). The majority reported that they enjoyed the exercise (PACES 3.74 [SD 
      0.16]). However, six participants had to drop out because of cybersickness 
      symptoms and two because of muscle pain due to prior injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggest that fully immersive VR training systems can contribute to 
      muscle-strengthening activities for healthy users. However, the dropout rate 
      highlights the need for technological improvements in both software and hardware. 
      In prevention and therapy, movement quality is a fundamental part of providing 
      effective resistance training that benefits health. Exergaming on a regular basis 
      has the potential to develop strong muscles and a healthy back. It is essential 
      that future VR-based training systems take into account the recommendations of 
      sport and exercise science.

LID - 1019
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of an exergame-driven high-intensity 
      interval training (HIIT) and its effects on cardiovascular fitness in untrained 
      community dwelling older adults. METHODS: Twelve older participants [10 women, 
      age 72.3 (SD: 4.44) years] performed a high-intensity interval exergame 
      intervention three times a week for 4 weeks. Data was acquired during two 
      baseline and one final measurement. Feasibility outcomes included attrition, 
      adherence, acceptability [Technology Acceptance Model Questionnaire (TAM)], 
      usability [System Usability Scale (SUS)], and enjoyment of exergaming. 
      Furthermore, participants' physical activity levels pre and post intervention 
      were compared to physical activity levels for similar types of training. The 
      secondary outcome was exercise capacity [heart rate at rest (HRrest), heart rate 
      variability (HRV), maximum heart rate (HRmax), and maximum workload (W, in watt)] 
      evaluated through maximal exercise testing. RESULTS: Eleven participants 
      completed the study (8% attrition), without any adverse events. Adherence to the 
      HIIT intervention was 91% and participants showed high acceptance of the 
      intervention with TAM scores between 5.8 and 6.7 points. User satisfaction was 
      rated as excellent (SUS total score: 93.5 of 100) and the overall enjoyment of 
      exergaming scored 4.5 of 5 possible points. Total exercise time ranged from 19 to 
      35 min with a mean of 30.8 (SD: 3.6) min. Actual high-intensity exercise time 
      showed consistency with the target exercise time in 98% percent of trainings. 
      Eighty-six percent of high-intensity intervals met the targeted intensity range 
      (>70-90% of HRmax). Thirty-six percent of the recovery periods were completed 
      with a heart rate above the target range of 50-70% of HRmax. Maximum workload (W) 
      during the incremental exercise test post-training increased significantly 
      compared to the baseline measurements one and two (p = 0.032, effect size r = 
      0.77 and p = 0.012, r = 0.87). CONCLUSION: High-intensity interval training 
      through exergaming is feasible, safe, and shows high usability and acceptance in 
      community dwelling older people. Exergame-driven HIIT had a significant effect on 
      maximum power output on an incremental exercise test. A more extensive exergame 
      intervention period, higher work to recovery ratios as well as a higher-intensity 
      activity should be considered in future projects.

TI  - Differences in hemodynamic characteristics under high packing density between the 
      porous media model and finite element analysis in computational fluid dynamics of 
      intracranial aneurysm virtual treatment.
PG  - 853-858
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-014218 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the hemodynamic differences among no sac 
      (NOS), porous media (POM) and finite element analysis (FEA) models to investigate 
      the recurrence-related risks for coiled intracranial aneurysms (IAs). METHODS: 
      The study enrolled 10 patients with 11 IAs who received simple coiling treatment 
      and hemodynamic simulations were performed for all IAs using the above three 
      models. Velocity, wall shear stress (WSS) and residual flow volume (RFV) were 
      calculated and compared in order to assess the model differences for both 
      aneurysm sac and parent vessel regions. RESULTS: For parent artery regions, all 
      three models produced similar flow patterns and quantification analysis did not 
      indicate differences in velocity and WSS (p>0.05). For aneurysm sac regions, the 
      FEA model resulted in higher sac-maximized (0.18 m/s vs 0.06 m/s) and 
      sac-averaged velocity (0.013 m/s vs 0.007 m/s), and higher sac-averaged (0.55 Pa 
      vs 0.36 Pa, p=0.006) and sac-maximized WSS (12.1 Pa vs 6.6 Pa) than the POM 
      model. The differences in RFV between the POM and FEA models under 11 different 
      isovelocity thresholds (0.0001 m/s, 0.001 m/s, 0.002 m/s, 0.005 m/s, 0.01 m/s, 
      0.02 m/s, 0.05 m/s, 0.1 m/s, 0.2 m/s, 0.5 m/s, and 1 m/s) showed that the POM RFV 
      was generally larger than those of the FEA model. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the 
      FEA model, the POM model provides a lower velocity and WSS and higher RFV for the 
      aneurysm sac, which could lead to incorrect estimates of the recurrent risk of 
      coiled IAs under high packing density.

TI  - Validation studies of virtual reality simulation performance metrics for 
      mechanical thrombectomy in ischemic stroke.
PG  - 775-780
LID - 10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-014510 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has transformed the treatment of 
      ischemic stroke. However, patient access to MT may be limited due to a shortage 
      of doctors specifically trained to perform MT. The studies reported here were 
      done to (1) develop, operationally define, and seek consensus from procedure 
      experts on the metrics which best characterize a reference procedure for the 
      performance of an MT for ischemic stroke and (2) evaluate their construct 
      validity when implemented in a virtual reality (VR) simulation. METHODS: In study 
      1, the metrics for a reference approach to an MT procedure for ischemic stroke of 
      10 phases, 46 steps, and 56 errors and critical errors, were presented to an 
      international Delphi panel of 21 consultant level interventional 
      neuroradiologists (INRs). In study 2, the metrics were used to assess 8 expert 
      and 10 novice INRs performing a VR simulated routine MT procedure. RESULTS: In 
      study 1, the Delphi panel reached consensus on the appropriateness of the 
      procedure metrics for a reference approach to MT in ischemic stroke. Group 
      differences in median scores in study 2 demonstrated that experienced INRs 
      performed the case 19% faster (P=0.029), completed 40% more procedure phases 
      (P=0.009), 20% more steps (P=0.012), and made 42% fewer errors (P=0.016) than the 
      novice group. CONCLUSIONS: The international Delphi panel agreed metrics 
      implemented in a VR simulation of MT distinguished between the computer scored 
      procedure performance of INR experts and novices. The studies reported here 
      support the demonstration of face, content, and construct validity of the MT 
      metrics.

TI  - Self-selected speed gait training in Parkinson's disease: robot-assisted gait 
      training with virtual reality versus gait training on the ground.
PG  - 456-462
LID - 10.23736/S1973-9087.18.05368-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder causing 
      progressive gait disability. Although robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) using 
      the Lokomat device has been demonstrated to improve gait in PD, it is not clear 
      what the best training settings are, in particular if a self-selected treadmill 
      speed can give better results. AIM: The aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate 
      if self-selected speed training using Lokomat plus virtual reality (VR) can give 
      better results compared to self-selected speed overground training; 2) to assess 
      the possible influence of VR on patients' gait speed in the Lokomat group. 
      DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. POPULATION: Patients with idiopathic PD (N.=20), 
      aged 18-90 years, Hoehn & Yahr 2-3, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) ≥24, 
      unchanged therapy, and without freezing episodes, dyskinesia, and neurological, 
      orthopedic, cardiac, respiratory or severe visual impairments, who underwent four 
      weeks of gait training (five 30-minute sessions/week): ten with Lokomat (Group 1) 
      and ten without (Group 2). SETTING: Rehabilitation hospital; inpatients. METHODS: 
      Group 1: Lokomat parameters: body weight support fixed at 30%, guidance force set 
      at 80% bilaterally. Treadmill speed was self-selected by each patient, and 
      subsequently modified on patient request. VR scenery was applied. Group 2: 
      self-selected speed gait training on the ground. Both groups were assessed pre- 
      and post-training with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), 
      Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale, and the 10-metre walking test 
      (10-MWT). For group 1, a VR score was evaluated. RESULTS: All patients showed 
      significant post-training improvement in UPDRS and FIM scores, with a 
      significantly better improvement in Group 1 for total UPDRS (P=0.037). Velocity 
      at 10-MWT significantly improved after rehabilitation in Group 2 (P=0.002). 
      Lokomat treadmill speed and VR score both improved significantly after 
      rehabilitation, but without any association (P=0.48), while a significant inverse 
      relationship (P=0.014) was observed between the changes in 10-MWT and in 
      treadmill speed. CONCLUSIONS: Self-selected speed Lokomat training in PD patients 
      can provide clinical enhancements but is not superior to self-selected speed 
      overground gait training; the influence of VR on motor performance seems to be 
      related to non-motor aspects. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Regarding 
      self-selected speed gait training, there seems to be no difference between RAGT 
      and conventional overground gait training. Other parameter settings for RAGT need 
      to be carefully investigated for a tailored use of RAGT in PD.

TI  - Bento Box: An Interactive and Zoomable Small Multiples Technique for Visualizing 
      4D Simulation Ensembles in Virtual Reality.
PG  - 61
LID - 10.3389/frobt.2019.00061 [doi]

AB  - We present Bento Box, a virtual reality data visualization technique and bimanual 
      3D user interface for exploratory analysis of 4D data ensembles. Bento Box helps 
      scientists and engineers make detailed comparative judgments about multiple 
      time-varying data instances that make up a data ensemble (e.g., a group of 10 
      parameterized simulation runs). The approach is to present an organized set of 
      complementary volume visualizations juxtaposed in a grid arrangement, where each 
      column visualizes a single data instance and each row provides a new view of the 
      volume from a different perspective and/or scale. A novel bimanual interface 
      enables users to select a sub-volume of interest to create a new row on-the-fly, 
      scrub through time, and quickly navigate through the resulting virtual "bento 
      box." The technique is evaluated through a real-world case study, supporting a 
      team of medical device engineers and computational scientists using in-silico 
      testing (supercomputer simulations) to redesign cardiac leads. The engineers 
      confirmed hypotheses and developed new insights using a Bento Box visualization. 
      An evaluation of the technical performance demonstrates that the proposed 
      combination of data sampling strategies and clipped volume rendering is 
      successful in displaying a juxtaposed visualization of 
      fluid-structure-interaction simulation data (39 GB of raw data) at interactive VR 
      frame rates.

AB  - Cardiovascular computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) 3-D thoracic 
      reconstruction can serve as a "virtual patient avatar" providing surgical views 
      for approach to complex anomalous coronary artery anatomy. Images demonstrated a 
      single coronary artery ostium arising from the right aortic sinus with 
      trifurcation into a prepulmonic left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), 
      an interarterial circumflex with a subsequent intraseptal course, and normal 
      course of the right coronary artery. Virtual 3-D CCTA reconstructions were 
      important to planning an incisional plane for surgical correction.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An accurate and real-time model of soft tissue is 
      critical for surgical simulation for which a user interacts haptically and 
      visually with simulated patients. This paper focuses on the real-time deformation 
      model of brain tissue for the interactive surgical simulation, such as 
      neurosurgical simulation. METHODS: A new Finite Element Method (FEM) based model 
      with constraints is proposed for the brain tissue in neurosurgical simulation. A 
      new energy function of constraints characterizing the interaction between the 
      virtual instrument and the soft tissue is incorporated into the optimization 
      problem derived from the implicit integration scheme. Distance and permanent 
      deformation constraints are introduced to describe the interaction in the 
      convexity meningioma dissection and hemostasis. The proposed model is 
      particularly suitable for GPU-based computing, making it possible to achieve 
      real-time performance. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Simulation results show that the 
      simulated soft tissue exhibits the behaviors of adhesion and permanent 
      deformation under the constraints. Experiments show that the proposed model is 
      able to converge to the exact solution of the implicit Euler method after 96 
      iterations. The proposed model was implemented in the development of a 
      neurosurgical simulator, in which surgical procedures such as dissection of 
      convexity meningioma and hemostasis were simulated.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the transfer of skills 
      between various levels of force feedback (FFB) using the Simodont dental trainer 
      (Moog, Nieuw-Vennep, the Netherlands). Students practiced a manual dexterity 
      exercise in a virtual reality environment at a standard level of FFB and then 
      were tested at the standard and an altered level of FFB. In addition, the 
      students' satisfaction with the training exercise was evaluated. METHODS: One 
      hundred twenty-six first-year dental students were randomly distributed into four 
      groups and underwent a manual dexterity test in the virtual reality environment 
      with automatic assessment after a 3-month period of practicing with standard FFB. 
      The test consisted of drilling with the standard FFB and an altered level of FFB 
      to evaluate the effect on performance. After the test, the participants completed 
      a questionnaire. RESULTS: The results showed that 74% of the students who passed 
      completed between one of three and three of three successful attempts at FFB 
      levels at which they had not previously practiced. CONCLUSIONS: The results of 
      this study imply that if students practice a sufficient amount of time at one 
      level of FFB, a skill is transferable from one level of FFB to another.

TI  - RIANet: Recurrent interleaved attention network for cardiac MRI segmentation.
PG  - 290-302

AB  - BACKGROUND: Segmentation of anatomical structures of the heart from cardiac 
      magnetic resonance images (MRI) has a significant impact on the quantitative 
      analysis of the cardiac contractile function. Although deep convolutional neural 
      networks (ConvNets) have achieved considerable success in medical imaging 
      segmentation, it is still a challenging task for existing deep ConvNets to 
      precisely and automatically segment multiple heart structures from cardiac MRI. 
      This paper presents a novel recurrent interleaved attention network (RIANet) to 
      comprehensively tackle this issue. METHOD: The proposed RIANet can efficiently 
      reuse parameters to encode richer representative features via introducing a 
      recurrent feedback structure, Clique Block, which incorporates both forward and 
      backward connections between different layers with the same resolution. Further, 
      we integrate a plug-and-play interleaved attention (IA) block to modulate the 
      information passed to the decoding stage of RIANet by effectively fusing 
      multi-level contextual information. In addition, we improve the discrimination 
      capability of our RIANet through a deep supervision mechanism with weighted 
      losses. RESULTS: The performance of RIANet has been extensively validated in the 
      segmentation contest of the ACDC 2017 challenge held in conjunction with MICCAI 
      2017, with mean Dice scores of 0.942 (left ventricular), 0.923 (right 
      ventricular) and 0.910 (myocardium) for cardiac MRI segmentation. Besides, we 
      visualize intermediate features of our RIANet using guided backpropagation, which 
      can intuitively depict the effects of our proposed components in feature 
      representation. CONCLUSION: Experimental results demonstrate that our RIANet have 
      achieved competitive segmentation results with fewer parameters compared with the 
      state-of-the-art approaches, corroborating the effectiveness and robustness of 
      our proposed RIANet.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Using a mobile virtual reality (VR) platform to heighten realism for 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training has the potential to improve 
      bystander response. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether using a VR mobile application 
      (mApp) for CPR training would improve bystander response compared with a standard 
      mApp CPR training. METHODS: We randomized lay bystanders to either our 
      intervention arm (VR mApp) or our control arm (mApp). During a post-intervention 
      skills test, we collected bystander response data (call 911, perform CPR, ask for 
      an automated external defibrillator (AED)), along with CPR quality (chest 
      compression (CC) rate and depth). Wilcox rank sum was used to analyze CC rate and 
      CC depth as they were not normally distributed; Pearson's Chi-square was used to 
      analyze Chain of Survival variables. RESULTS: Between 3/2018 and 9/2018, 105 
      subjects were enrolled: 52 VR mApp and 53 mApp. Mean age was 46 ± 16 years, 34% 
      were female, 59% were Black, and 17% were currently CPR trained (≤2 years). 
      Bystander response was significantly higher in the VR mApp arm: called 911 (82% 
      vs 58%, p = 0.007) and asked for an AED (57% vs 28%, p = 0.003). However there 
      was no difference in CPR performed (98% vs 98%, p = NS) and the application of 
      the AED (90% vs 93%, p = NS). When comparing the VR mApp to the mApp, mean CC 
      rate was 104 ± 42 cpm vs 112 ± 30 cpm (p = NS), and mean CC depth was 38 ± 15 mm 
      vs 44 ± 13 mm (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: The use of the VR mApp significantly 
      increased the likelihood of calling 911 and asking for an AED, however, CC depth 
      was decreased.

TI  - Space motion sickness: A common neurovestibular dysfunction in microgravity.
PG  - S214-S218
LID - 10.4103/0028-3886.259127 [doi]
AB  - This article presents a review of the current findings related to neurovestibular 
      physiology, aetiology, and proposed theories on space motion sickness (SMS) 
      during acute and sustained exposure to microgravity. The review discusses the 
      available treatment options including medication and nonpharmacological 
      countermeasure methods that help to prevent the development of SMS in 
      weightlessness. Ground-based simulations using virtual reality, flight 
      simulations, and Barany's chairs can be applied to study SMS and demonstrate its 
      signs and symptoms to space crew members. Space motion sickness has been observed 
      in approximately 70% of astronauts within the first 72 h in microgravity, having 
      in general an instantaneous onset of signs and symptoms. Stomach discomfort, 
      nausea, vomiting, pallor, cold sweating, salivation, tachypnoea, belching, 
      fatigue, drowsiness, and stress hormone release have been documented. This can 
      have detrimental effects on the well-being of astronauts in the initial phase of 
      a space mission. Mental and physical performance may be affected, jeopardizing 
      operational procedures and mission safety.

TI  - The effects of locomotor training in children with spinal cord injury: a 
      systematic review.
PG  - 272-287
LID - 10.1080/17518423.2018.1487474 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Discuss the effectiveness of locomotor training (LT) in children 
      following spinal cord injury (SCI). This intervention was assessed following an 
      exhaustive search of the literature using the Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses: The PRISMA Statement as a guideline. 
      METHOD: Six databases were searched including PubMed, PEDro, CINAHL, Cochrane, 
      PsycINFO, and Web of Knowledge in January 2016 and November 2016, without date 
      restrictions. Inclusion criteria were: studies in English and peer-reviewed and 
      journal articles with a primary intervention of LT in children following SCI. 
      RESULTS: Twelve articles, reporting eleven studies, were included. A systematic 
      review assessing locomotor training in children with SCI published in April 2016 
      was also included. Participants were ages 15 months to 18 years old. Forms of LT 
      included body-weight supported treadmill or over ground training, functional 
      electrical stimulation, robotics, and virtual reality. Protocols differed in 
      set-up and delivery mode, with improvements seen in ambulation for all 41 
      participants following LT. CONCLUSION: Children might benefit from LT to develop 
      or restore ambulation following SCI. Age, completeness, and level of injury 
      remain the most important prognostic factors to consider with this intervention. 
      Additional benefits include improved bowel/ bladder management and control, bone 
      density, cardiovascular endurance, and overall quality of life. Looking beyond 
      the effects LT has just on ambulation is crucial because it can offer benefits to 
      all children sustaining a SCI, even if restoration or development of walking is 
      not the primary goal. Further rigorous research is required to determine the 
      overall effectiveness of LT.

AB  - Our study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mentored simulation training 
      (ST) in coronary angiography and to assess the transferability of acquired skills 
      from virtual reality to the real world. Twenty cardiology residents were 
      randomized to ST or control before performing real-life cases in the 
      catheterization laboratory. The control group underwent secondary ST and 
      reperformed real-life cases in the catheterization laboratory. Skill metrics were 
      compared between the ST and the control group, and within the control group 
      between before and after ST. In real-life cases, the procedure time was shorter 
      (p = 0.002), the radiation dose lower (p = 0.001), and the global procedure skill 
      score was higher (p = 0.0001) in the ST group as compared with the control 
      (before ST) group. During virtual ST procedural time (p <0.001), fluoroscopic 
      time (p <0.001), training contrast amount (p <0.001), and global training score 
      (p <0.001) significantly decreased. In the control group, all monitoring 
      procedure parameters were significantly improved after ST, as well as, the global 
      procedure flow score (p <0.0001). In conclusion, simulator-based training in 
      coronary angiography improved operator skills compared with traditional in 
      catheterization laboratory mentor-based training. ST should be incorporated in 
      the curriculum of the interventionalist to improve learning in coronary 
      angiography.

      cardiac catheterisation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Unobtrusive metrics that can auto-assess performance during 
      clinical procedures are of value. Three approaches to deriving wearable 
      technology-based metrics are explored: (1) eye tracking, (2) psychophysiological 
      measurements [e.g. electrodermal activity (EDA)] and (3) arm and hand movement 
      via accelerometry. We also measure attentional capacity by tasking the operator 
      with an additional task to track an unrelated object during the procedure. 
      METHODS: Two aspects of performance are measured: (1) using eye gaze and 
      psychophysiology metrics and (2) measuring attentional capacity via an additional 
      unrelated task (to monitor a visual stimulus/playing cards). The aim was to 
      identify metrics that can be used to automatically discriminate between levels of 
      performance or at least between novices and experts. The study was conducted 
      using two groups: (1) novice operators and (2) expert operators. Both groups made 
      two attempts at a coronary angiography procedure using a full-physics virtual 
      reality simulator. Participants wore eye tracking glasses and an E4 wearable 
      wristband. Areas of interest were defined to track visual attention on display 
      screens, including: (1) X-ray, (2) vital signs, (3) instruments and (4) the 
      stimulus screen (for measuring attentional capacity). RESULTS: Experts provided 
      greater dwell time (63% vs 42%, p = 0.03) and fixations (50% vs 34%, p = 0.04) on 
      display screens. They also provided greater dwell time (11% vs 5%, p = 0.006) and 
      fixations (9% vs 4%, p = 0.007) when selecting instruments. The experts' 
      performance for tracking the unrelated object during the visual stimulus task 
      negatively correlated with total errors (r = - 0.95, p = 0.0009). Experts also 
      had a higher standard deviation of EDA (2.52 µS vs 0.89 µS, p = 0.04). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Eye tracking metrics may help discriminate between a novice and 
      expert operator, by showing that experts maintain greater visual attention on the 
      display screens. In addition, the visual stimulus study shows that an unrelated 
      task can measure attentional capacity. Trial registration This work is registered 
      through clinicaltrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Health Institute, and 
      is identified by the trial reference: NCT02928796.

TI  - Using an Immersive Virtual Reality System to Assess Lay Provider Response to an 
      Unannounced Simulated Sudden Cardiac Arrest in the Out-of-Hospital Setting.
PG  - 82-89
LID - 10.1097/SIH.0000000000000338 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs when the heart abruptly stops 
      beating; because of the nature of SCA, capturing data in the out-of-hospital 
      setting from actual bystander response is difficult. Current technologies such as 
      virtual reality (VR) allow the creation of scenarios programmed for heightened 
      realism. No studies have used an immersive VR system to observe lay bystander 
      response. OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize lay bystander response to an 
      unannounced simulated VR SCA event during a multisensory scenario. METHODS: Using 
      a VR wearable device combined with a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
      recording manikin, we created a 3-minute multisensory SCA scenario that allowed 
      for the observation of lay bystander response. Subjects were unaware of the 
      nature of the emergency event but were told to respond how they would to an 
      emergency situation. Subject's ability to proceed through the American Heart 
      Association's Chain of Survival and their CPR quality were recorded. Frequencies 
      and percentages were calculated using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Between 
      June 2016 and June 2017, 119 lay subjects were enrolled. Of those, 92% asked for 
      911 to be called, 81% attempted CPR, 13% requested an automated external 
      defibrillator (AED), and 6% used the AED; 82% stated that they felt as if they 
      were at a real SCA event. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation data were collected (n = 
      81), the mean CC rate was 93.5 ± 22.4 cpm, and the mean CC depth was 38.4 ± 13.8 
      mm. CONCLUSIONS: In our unannounced, immersive VR SCA observational study of lay 
      bystanders, most subjects attempted CPR, although the majority did not use an 
      AED.

TI  - Role of Digital Games in Self-Management of Cardiovascular Diseases: A Scoping 
      Review.
PG  - 65-73
LID - 10.1089/g4h.2018.0011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Examine research on the use of digital games to improve 
      self-management (SM) behaviors in patients diagnosed with cardiovascular 
      diagnoses of hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, or myocardial 
      infarction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this scoping review, the CINAHL, PubMed, 
      and Web of Science databases were searched for studies published from January 1, 
      2008 to December 20, 2017 using terms relevant to digital games and 
      cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). RESULTS: Eight articles met the 
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, seven of which presented studies with participants 
      50 years or older. Five of the eight studies assessed physical activity. Only two 
      studies included a control group. Digital games significantly improved exercise 
      capacity and energy expenditure but did not affect quality of life, 
      self-efficacy, anxiety, or depression. Digital games were found enjoyable by 
      79%-93% of participants, including those with lower education or age; however, 
      barriers to game use included being tired or bored, lack of interest in digital 
      games, poor perception of fitness through games, sensor limitations, conflicts 
      with daily life routine, and preferences for group exercise. Average adherence 
      ranged from 70% to 100% over 2 weeks to 6 months of study duration, with higher 
      adherence rates in studies that included human contact through supervision or 
      social support. CONCLUSION: Paucity of studies about digital games for CVD SM 
      behaviors precludes the need to undertake a full systematic review. Future 
      studies examining digital games should include larger sample sizes, longer 
      durations, game-design guided by behavioral change theoretical frameworks, and 
      CVD SM behaviors in addition to physical activity behaviors.

TI  - The Application of Virtual Reality for Preoperative Planning of Lymphovenous 
      Anastomosis in a Patient with a Complex Lymphatic Malformation.
LID - 10.3390/jcm8030371 [doi]
LID - 371
AB  - The management of lymphatic malformations (LMs) is challenging, particularly for 
      large and complex lesions involving anatomical structures in the adjacent tissue. 
      While lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA) has been reported as an effective treatment 
      for lymphedema, it has hardly been described as a treatment for LM. Virtual 
      reality has the ability to visualize human structures in three dimensions and can 
      be used for the preoperative planning of complex cases. Here, we describe the 
      first case of the management of an LM by LVA preoperatively planned with virtual 
      reality. A young woman presented with an LM previously treated by gross excision. 
      Following persistent complaints of swelling, a minimally invasive microsurgical 
      intervention was planned. The results of the single photon emission tomography 
      with computed tomography (SPECT-CT) and lymphoscintigraphy were analyzed using a 
      virtual reality program, and a 3D patient-specific model was constructed. Based 
      on the combined findings of this 3D model and lymphography with a fluorescent 
      marker, a precise skin incision could be determined and one lymph vessel was 
      anastomosed to a nearby vein. The swelling of the thigh reduced and the 
      discomfort disappeared. Although more reports are needed to confirm its efficacy, 
      LVA planned with virtual reality constructed images appears to be a valuable 
      treatment option for complex lesions, including LMs.

TI  - Virtual reality and cardiac anatomy: Exploring immersive three-dimensional 
      cardiac imaging, a pilot study in undergraduate medical anatomy education.

AB  - Cardiac anatomy can be challenging to grasp because of its complex 
      three-dimensional nature and remains one of the most challenging topics to teach. 
      In light of some exciting technological advances in the field of virtual reality 
      (VR), we sought to test the viability and the assess efficacy of this 
      computer-generated model for the purposes of teaching cardiac anatomy. Before 
      learning cardiac anatomy, first-year undergraduate medical students participated 
      in an anatomically correct VR simulation of the heart. Students were randomly 
      distributed into control and variable groups. Each student completed a 
      pre-intervention quiz, consisting of 10 multiple choice questions with 5 
      conventional cardiac anatomy questions and 5 visual-spatial (VS) questions. The 
      control group continued to independent study, whereas the variable group subjects 
      were exposed to a 30-min immersive cardiac VR experience. At the end of the 
      intervention, both the groups underwent a separate post-intervention 10-question 
      quiz. Forty-two students participated in the cardiac VR experiment, separated 
      into 14 control and 28 variable subjects. They scored 50.9% on average on the 
      pre-intervention quiz (SD = 16.5) and 70.2% on the post-intervention quiz (SD = 
      18.7). Compared to the control group, the students exposed to VR scored 21.4% 
      higher in conventional content (P = 0.004), 26.4% higher in VS content (P < 
      0.001), and 23.9% higher overall (P < 0.001). VR offers an anatomically correct 
      and immersive VS environment that permits learner to interact three-dimensionally 
      with the heart's anatomy. This study demonstrates the viability and the 
      effectiveness of VR in teaching cardiac anatomy. Clin. Anat. 32:238-243, 2019. ©

TI  - Advancing Cardiac Surgery Case Planning and Case Review Conferences Using Virtual 
      Reality in Medical Libraries: Evaluation of the Usability of Two Virtual Reality 
      Apps.
PG  - e12008
LID - 10.2196/12008 [doi]
LID - e12008
AB  - BACKGROUND: Care providers and surgeons prepare for cardiac surgery using case 
      conferences to review, discuss, and run through the surgical procedure. Surgeons 
      visualize a patient's anatomy to decide the right surgical approach using 
      magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiograms in a presurgical case planning 
      session. Previous studies have shown that surgical errors can be reduced through 
      the effective use of immersive virtual reality (VR) to visualize patient anatomy. 
      However, inconsistent user interfaces, delegation of view control, and 
      insufficient depth information cause user disorientation and interaction 
      difficulties in using VR apps for case planning. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the 
      study was to evaluate and compare the usability of 2 commercially available VR 
      apps-Bosc (Pyrus Medical systems) and Medical Holodeck (Nooon Web & IT 
      GmbH)-using the Vive VR headset (HTC Corporation) to evaluate ease of use, 
      physician attitudes toward VR technology, and viability for presurgical case 
      planning. The role of medical libraries in advancing case planning is also 
      explored. METHODS: After screening a convenience sample of surgeons, fellows, and 
      residents, ethnographic interviews were conducted to understand physician 
      attitudes and experience with VR. Gaps in current case planning methods were also 
      examined. We ran a usability study, employing a concurrent think-aloud protocol. 
      To evaluate user satisfaction, we used the system usability scale (SUS) and the 
      National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). A 
      poststudy questionnaire was used to evaluate the VR experience and explore the 
      role of medical libraries in advancing presurgical case planning. Semistructured 
      interview data were analyzed using content analysis with feedback categorization. 
      RESULTS: Participants were residents, fellows, and surgeons from the University 
      of Washington with a mean age of 41.5 (SD 11.67) years. A total of 8 surgeons 
      participated in the usability study, 3 of whom had prior exposure to VR. Users 
      found Medical Holodeck easier to use than Bosc. Mean adjusted NASA-TLX score for 
      Medical Holodeck was 62.71 (SD 18.25) versus Bosc's 40.87 (SD 13.90). Neither app 
      passed the mean SUS score of 68 for an app to be considered usable, though 
      Medical Holodeck (66.25 [SD 12.87]) scored a higher mean SUS than Bosc (37.19 [SD 
      22.41]). One user rated the Bosc usable, whereas 3 users rated Medical Holodeck 
      usable. CONCLUSIONS: Interviews highlighted the importance of precise anatomical 
      conceptualization in presurgical case planning and teaching, identifying it as 
      the top reason for modifying a surgical procedure. The importance of standardized 
      user interaction features such as labeling is justified. The study also sheds 
      light on the new roles medical librarians can play in curating VR content and 
      promoting interdisciplinary collaboration.

TI  - A Social Virtual Reality-Based Application for the Physical and Cognitive 
      Training of the Elderly at Home.
LID - 10.3390/s19020261 [doi]
LID - 261
AB  - Frailty is a clinical condition affecting the elderly population which results in 
      an increased risk of falls. Previous studies demonstrated that falls prevention 
      programs are effective, but they suffer from low adherence, especially when 
      subjects have to train unsupervised in their homes. To try to improve treatment 
      adherence, virtual reality and social media have been proposed as promising 
      strategies for the increase of users' motivation and thus their willingness to 
      practice. In the context of smart homes, this work presents SocialBike, a virtual 
      reality-based application aimed at improving the clinical outcomes of older frail 
      adults in their houses. Indeed, SocialBike is integrated in the "house of the 
      future" framework and proposes a Dual Task training program in which the users 
      are required to cycle on a stationary bike while recognizing target animals or 
      objects appearing along the way. It also implements the possibility of training 
      with other users, thus reducing the risk of social isolation. Within SocialBike, 
      users can choose the multiplayer mode they prefer (i.e., collaborative or 
      competitive), and are allowed to train following their own attitude. SocialBike's 
      validation, refinement, and business model are currently under development, and 
      are briefly discussed as future works.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding bystander reactions to an emergency is an important 
      component of effective training. Four stages of bystander intervention (BI) have 
      been previously described: noticing the situation as a problem, interpreting when 
      it is appropriate to intervene, recognizing personal responsibility to intervene, 
      and knowing how to intervene. Using virtual reality (VR) to simulate emergencies 
      such as sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) can be used to study these stages. METHODS: 
      In a secondary analysis of an observational cohort study, we analyzed bystander 
      self-efficacy for stages of BI before and after simulated SCA. Each subject 
      participated in a single-player, immersive, VR SCA scenario. Subjects interacted 
      with simulated bystanders through voice commands ("call 911", "get an AED"). 
      Actions taken in scenario, like performing CPR, were documented. Scenario BI 
      actions were compared based on dichotomized comfort/discomfort. RESULTS: From 
      June 2016 to June 2017, 119 subjects participated. Average age was 37±14 years, 
      44% were female and 46% reported CPR training within 2 years. During the 
      scenario, 98% "noticed the event" and "interpreted it as a problem", 78% "took 
      responsibility", and 54% "possessed the necessary skills". Self-efficacy 
      increased from pre- to post-scenario: noticing the event increased from 80% to 
      96%; interpreting as a problem increased from 86% to 97%; taking responsibility 
      increased from 56% to 93%; possessing necessary skills increased from 47% to 63% 
      (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Self-efficacy to respond to an SCA event increased pre- to 
      post-scenario. Bystanders who reported feeling comfortable "taking responsibility 
      to intervene" during an emergency were more likely to take action during a 
      simulated emergency.

TI  - The relevance of low-fidelity virtual reality simulators compared with other 
      learning methods in basic endovascular skills training.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The use of simulators has shown a profound impact on the development 
      of both training and assessment of endovascular skills. Furthermore, there is 
      evidence that simulator training is of great benefit for novice trainees. 
      However, there are only a few simulators available geared specifically toward 
      novice learners. Whereas research suggests that low-fidelity simulators could 
      fill this gap, there are insufficient data available to determine the role of 
      low-fidelity simulators in the training of endovascular skills. METHODS: Medical 
      students in their fifth year (N = 50) with no previous endovascular experience 
      were randomized into three groups: conventional learning through a video podcast 
      (group V; n = 12), low-fidelity simulation training with tablet-paired 
      touch-gesture navigation (group A; n = 12), and low-fidelity simulation training 
      with tablet-paired physical endovascular tool navigation (group S; n = 26). 
      Within their respective groups, all students attended a 1-day class on basic 
      endovascular skills. Questionnaire items for self-assessment before and after the 
      class and assessment after the class of the participant's practical skills on a 
      high-fidelity simulator were analyzed across all three groups as well as for each 
      group separately using nonparametric tests. RESULTS: All 50 participants 
      completed the training. Participants in group S showed a significantly increased 
      interest in working in interventional cardiology (P = .02) and vascular surgery 
      (P = .03) after the class. Evaluation of the questionnaire items after the class 
      showed that participants in group S rated their practical skills significantly 
      higher after the class compared with those in group V and group A (P < .001 for 
      pairwise comparison of all three groups, respectively), creating a significant 
      trend across the three groups. However, analysis of the practical skills 
      assessment for all three groups showed a significant difference between the 
      groups only for choosing a guidewire (P = .045) and a significant trend in 
      performance across the groups for choosing a guidewire and for positioning the 
      guidewire in the vessel (P = .02 and P = .05, respectively). All other steps of 
      the skills assessment showed no significant differences or a trend across the 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Low-fidelity simulation training, particularly with physical 
      endovascular tool navigation, led to increased motivation in novice trainees. 
      Whereas simulator training was associated with increased confidence of trainees 
      in their skills, assessment of their practical skills showed no actual 
      improvement in this study. Overall, low-fidelity simulation has the potential to 
      benefit novice trainees, but possible risks of simulation training should be 
      further evaluated.

AB  - Imaging of the heart anatomy plays an important role, especially in catheter 
      ablation for the treatment of arrhythmias in adults with congenital heart disease 
      (ACHD). We present a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art 
      modalities available to plan and guide catheter ablation in an ACHD patient. In 
      addition to the clinical assessment of the computed tomography and the 
      integration of 3D reconstructions into the electroanatomical mapping system, 3D 
      printing and virtual reality assessment showed its value in preprocedural 
      planning of the intervention.

PG  - 260-264
LID - 10.5603/CJ.a2017.0154 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with high risk of stroke and 
      other thromboembolic complications. The OCULUS study aimed to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of the three-dimensional (3D) movie in teaching patients about the 
      consequences of AF and pharmacological stroke prevention. METHODS: The study was 
      based on a questionnaire and included 100 consecutive patients (38% women, 62% 
      with AF history). Using the oculus glasses and a smartphone, a 3D movie 
      describing the risk of stroke in AF was shown. Similar questions were asked 
      immediately after, 1 week and 1 year after the projection. RESULTS: Before the 
      projection 22/100 (22.0%) declared stroke a consequence of AF, while immediately 
      after 83/100 (83.0%) (p < 0.0001) patients declared this consequence. Seven days 
      after, stroke as AF consequence was chosen by 74/94 (78.7%) vs. 22/94 (23.4%) 
      when compared to the baseline knowledge; p < 0.0001, a similar trend was also 
      observed in 1-year follow-up (64/90 [71.1%] vs. 21/90 [23.3%]; p < 0.0001). 
      Before the projection 88.3% (83/94) patients responded, that drugs may reduce the 
      risk of stroke, and after 1 week the number of patients increased to (94/94 
      [100%]; p = 0.001). After 1 year 87/90 (96.7%) answered that drugs may diminish 
      the risk of stroke (p = 0.02 in comparison to the baseline survey 78/90 [86.7%]). 
      Use of oral anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke was initially chosen by 
      66/94 (70.2%), by 90/94 (95.7%; p < 0.0001) 7 days after and by 83/90 (92.2%; p < 
      0.0001) 1 year after. CONCLUSIONS: 3D movie is an effective tool in transferring 
      knowledge about the consequences of AF and the pivotal role of oral 
      anticoagulation in stroke prevention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov,

      understanding.

LID - 15
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose was to create a time sequential three-dimensional virtual 
      reality model, also referred to as a four-dimensional model, to explore its 
      possible benefit and clinical applications. We hypothesized that this novel 
      solution allows for the visuospatial benefits of the 3D model and the dynamic 
      benefits of other existing imaging modalities. BACKGROUND: We have seen how 3D 
      models hold great value in medical decision making by eliminating the variable 
      visuospatial skills of practitioners. They have proved especially invaluable 
      concerning the correction of congenital heart defects and have altered the course 
      of many surgeries. There are, however, limitations to three-dimensional models. 
      The static models only show what the heart looks like in one snapshot of its 
      cycle and do not allow for an understanding of the physiological and dynamic 
      processes. METHODS: This solution segments a 3D heart derived from a 2D image 
      stack, times the 18 phases of a cardiac cycle and creates a 4D model that can be 
      manipulated in space and time through the use of virtual reality. RESULTS: We 
      believe the 4D heart provides a unique understanding of in situ cardiac anatomy 
      not possible with other imaging techniques. Our expanding case series of 
      clinician experiences and their immediate recognition of the potency of this 
      technique is highly encouraging and reveals the future of functional and dynamic 
      4D representations of anatomy. CONCLUSIONS: The 4D heart improved our 
      understanding around complex 3D relationships over time. We propose time and 
      effort dedicated to 4D cardiac imaging analysis of dynamic cardiac pathologies 
      such as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or a pre-op Rastelli repair with 
      a narrow outflow tract could offer tremendous insight into the medical 
      decision-making process.

AB  - The ongoing refinements in 3-dimensional (3D) echocardiography technology 
      continue to expand the scope of this imaging modality in clinical cardiology by 
      offering new features that stem from the ability to image the heart in its 
      complete dimensionality. Over the years, countless publications have described 
      these benefits and tested new frontiers where 3D echocardiographic imaging seemed 
      to offer promising ways to improve patients' care. These include improved 
      techniques for chamber quantification and novel ways to visualize cardiac valves, 
      including 3D printing, virtual reality, and holography. The aims of this review 
      article are to focus on the most important developments in the field in the 
      recent years, discuss the current utility of 3D echocardiography, and highlight 
      several interesting future directions.

TI  - A tensor-mass method-based vascular model and its performance evaluation for 
      interventional surgery virtual reality simulator.
PG  - e1946
LID - 10.1002/rcs.1946 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physics-based vascular modelling is an essential issue to be 
      addressed in the development of the endovascular interventional surgery training 
      system, which helps to shorten the training period of novice surgeons to obtain 
      dexterous skills of surgical operation. METHODS: A blood vessel model based on 
      tensor-mass method (TMM) is formulated and implemented in this context. A 
      multimodel representation is adopted for the vascular model, including the 
      mechanical, visual, and collision model. Triangular and tetrahedral TMM are 
      formulated and implemented in Simulation Open-source Framework Architecture 
      (SOFA). An extensional formulation and analysis of two typical methods are 
      implemented in SOFA. Meanwhile, a set of experiments were conducted to test the 
      refresh rate, the stability, and the visual realism of the vascular deformation 
      simulation, integrating with TMM, mass-spring model, and finite element method. 
      RESULTS: The experimental and subjects' testing results prove that TMM 
      outperforms the current physically based methods in realistic and real-time 
      vascular deformation simulation, which provides a refresh rate up to 256 frame 
      per second on a triangular vascular topology. CONCLUSIONS: The vascular model 
      presented herein provides a fundamental module meeting the real-time and 
      realistic requirements of our endovascular interventional surgery simulator.

TI  - Simulating Developmental Cardiac Morphology in Virtual Reality Using a Deformable 
      Image Registration Approach.
PG  - 2177-2188
LID - 10.1007/s10439-018-02113-z [doi]
AB  - While virtual reality (VR) has potential in enhancing cardiovascular diagnosis 
      and treatment, prerequisite labor-intensive image segmentation remains an 
      obstacle for seamlessly simulating 4-dimensional (4-D, 3-D + time) imaging data 
      in an immersive, physiological VR environment. We applied deformable image 
      registration (DIR) in conjunction with 3-D reconstruction and VR implementation 
      to recapitulate developmental cardiac contractile function from light-sheet 
      fluorescence microscopy (LSFM). This method addressed inconsistencies that would 
      arise from independent segmentations of time-dependent data, thereby enabling the 
      creation of a VR environment that fluently simulates cardiac morphological 
      changes. By analyzing myocardial deformation at high spatiotemporal resolution, 
      we interfaced quantitative computations with 4-D VR. We demonstrated that our 
      LSFM-captured images, followed by DIR, yielded average dice similarity 
      coefficients of 0.92 ± 0.05 (n = 510) and 0.93 ± 0.06 (n = 240) when compared to 
      ground truth images obtained from Otsu thresholding and manual segmentation, 
      respectively. The resulting VR environment simulates a wide-angle zoomed-in view 
      of motion in live embryonic zebrafish hearts, in which the cardiac chambers are 
      undergoing structural deformation throughout the cardiac cycle. Thus, this 
      technique allows for an interactive micro-scale VR visualization of developmental 
      cardiac morphology to enable high resolution simulation for both basic and 
      clinical science.

AB  - Herein, we report the unique case of a 75-year-old male patient who had undergone 
      a left upper lobectomy for lung cancer and developed an incidental superficial 
      endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma in the right upper lobe that was not 
      localizable on modern cross-sectional imaging modalities. The superficial 
      endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma was successfully localized by computed 
      tomography-driven virtual reality endoscopy and was identically matched with a 
      small, whitish, patch lesion on bronchoscopy. The localized lesion was annotated 
      on the corresponding computed tomography images, and illustrated in a fabricated 
      three-dimensional (3D)-printed airway model. Because the exact anatomic location 
      of the lesion and the acute angle of the adjacent bronchial trajectory were 
      visible in the 3D model, enhanced multidisciplinary consultation resulted in the 
      decision to treat the lesion using photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic therapy was 
      successfully performed without complications. A follow-up bronchoscopy two months 
      after treatment confirmed that the superficial endobronchial squamous cell 
      carcinoma had been cured.

TI  - Development of a modeling pipeline for the prediction of hemodynamic outcome 
      after virtual mitral valve repair using image-based CFD.
PG  - 1795-1805
LID - 10.1007/s11548-018-1821-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Severe mitral valve regurgitation can either be treated by a replacement 
      or a repair of the valve. The latter is recommended due to lower perioperative 
      mortality and better long-term survival. On the other hand, recurrence rates 
      after mitral valve repair are high compared to those after replacements and the 
      repair intervention can cause induced mitral valve stenosis. So far, there are no 
      methods to predict the hemodynamic outcome of a chosen treatment or to compare 
      different treatment options in advance. To overcome this, diastolic mitral valve 
      hemodynamics are simulated using computational fluid dynamics after different 
      virtual treatments of the valve. METHODS: The left ventricular geometry of one 
      patient was reconstructed using trans-esophageal echocardiography and computed 
      tomography data. Pre-op hemodynamics are simulated using a referenced wall model 
      to avoid expansive modeling of wall motion. Subsequently, the flow structures are 
      compared to in vivo measurements. After manipulating the patient-specific 
      geometry in order to mimic a restrictive mitral annuloplasty as well as a 
      MitraClip intervention, hemodynamics results are calculated. RESULTS: Good 
      agreements exist between calculated pre-op hemodynamics and in vivo measurements. 
      The virtual annuloplasty did not result in any remarkable change of hemodynamics. 
      Neither the pressure drop nor the velocity field showed strong differences. In 
      contrast, the virtual MitraClip intervention led to a complete change in blood 
      flow structures as well as an elevated pressure drop across the valve. 
      CONCLUSION: The presented approach allows fast simulation of the diastolic 
      hemodynamic situation before and after treatment of a mitral valve insufficiency. 
      However, this approach is limited to the early diastolic phase of the cardiac 
      cycle and needs to be validated using a larger sample size.

TI  - Manufacturing Better Outcomes in Cardiovascular Intervention: 3D Printing in 
      Clinical Practice Today.
PG  - 95
LID - 10.1007/s11936-018-0692-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Describe and evaluate the integration of 3D printing-related 
      innovations into current cardiovascular treatment paradigms and examine the state 
      of regulatory and reimbursement hurdles ahead. RECENT FINDINGS: Mounting years of 
      clinical experience have established the utility of printed models of patient 
      anatomy in numerous treatment and teaching scenarios, most notably as pre- and 
      intra-procedural planning tools guiding decision-making for congenital heart 
      disease and catheter-based interventions. In part due to a continued lack of 
      reimbursement and under-defined (and slow to evolve) regulatory status, these use 
      cases remain largely investigational even as they grow increasingly routine. 
      Patients, physicians, and/or imaging centers therefore remain burdened by the 
      associated cost to create such models, and the perceptual and decision-making 
      enhancements, while demonstrable and significant, still may not clearly or 
      independently justify a potentially high cost. Simulation and implantable device 
      applications may represent a deeper well of unrealized value in cardiovascular 
      intervention; however, further development of these applications relies on-and is 
      throttled by-progress in material science and tissue-engineering research. The 
      relevance of simulation applications in recent years is also now in competition 
      with digital analogs including augmented and virtual reality. Innovative 
      incorporation of alternative manufacturing processes such as porous scaffold 
      infusion, injection molding, and vascular mesh forming can provide immediate 
      access to more realistic tissue-mimicking materials and custom implantable 
      devices, while comparable and directly printable materials continue to be 
      developed. Tissue-engineering applications remain years if not decades away from 
      a more substantive role in translatable clinical research. Regulatory challenges 
      associated with in-house manufacture of implantable investigational devices are 
      complex and subject to change, and the success of some in navigating these 
      hurdles in non-cardiovascular applications is instructive and encouraging. 
      Complex geometries characterizing cardiovascular anatomy are an ideal use case 
      for translating the perceptual advantages of printed models of patient anatomy 
      into better decision-making, especially so in the setting of congenital or 
      post-surgical anatomy. Procedural planning applications take further advantage of 
      the demonstrably robust dimensional reproduction of patient anatomy, with notably 
      rapid integration into surgical and catheter-based intervention workflows. 
      Despite a continued lack of codification in the healthcare system, 2018 could be 
      a milestone year for 3D printing services, pending a successful application for a 
      CPT Category III designation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The ability to walk is one of the most important basic functional 
      activities of daily living, and the number of patients with walking disability 
      who need rehabilitation is increasing worldwide. The purpose of this first-in-man 
      study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of an off-label, tailor-made, 
      dual-task rehabilitation program for body trunk balance using the mediVR01 system 
      (mediVR, Inc. Osaka, Japan), which incorporates virtual reality (VR) and 
      three-dimensional tracking technologies. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 31 
      healthy volunteers to take part in the trial (Trial Registration UMIN000029659). 
      After an assessment of body trunk balance, a tailor-made, dual-task, 
      rehabilitation training program lasting 10-15 min was provided. The primary 
      endpoint was the postprocedural number of simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) 
      symptoms. The secondary endpoints were adverse events and satisfaction with the 
      program. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 68 years, with 67.7% being 
      elderly (>65 years) and 54.8% being male. The number of SSQ symptoms immediately 
      after the rehabilitation programs significantly increased from 0 (interquartile 
      range 0-0) to 0 (0-1.5) (P=0.009), with a significant difference between the 
      young and elderly participants (P-interaction<0.001). The most frequent symptom 
      was sweating (22.6%), followed by fatigue (19.4%). All participants successfully 
      completed the rehabilitation programs without significant adverse events such as 
      fall or injuries. Moreover, all participants considered the VR rehabilitation 
      programs to be enjoyable, and 93.5% of participants reported a sense of 
      achievement. Group attendance was associated with higher levels of satisfaction 
      (P=0.049). CONCLUSION: The tailor-made, dual-task rehabilitation training 
      programs for body trunk balance using VR and three-dimensional tracking 
      technologies were safe and feasible even for elderly participants.

PG  - 148-153
LID - 10.1049/htl.2018.5064 [doi]
AB  - The authors present a method to interconnect the Visualisation Toolkit (VTK) and 
      Unity. This integration enables them to exploit the visualisation capabilities of 
      VTK with Unity's widespread support of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality 
      displays, and interaction and manipulation devices, for the development of 
      medical image applications for virtual environments. The proposed method utilises 
      OpenGL context sharing between Unity and VTK to render VTK objects into the Unity 
      scene via a Unity native plugin. The proposed method is demonstrated in a simple 
      Unity application that performs VTK volume rendering to display thoracic computed 
      tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance images. Quantitative measurements of 
      the achieved frame rates show that this approach provides over 90 fps using 
      standard hardware, which is suitable for current augmented reality/virtual 
      reality display devices.

AB  - The virtual version of the Trier Social Stress Test (V-TSST) is an effective and 
      standardized tool for social stress induction. This study aimed to examine gut 
      permeability and physiological and inflammatory markers of reactivity to acute 
      psychosocial stress. Forty young men were classified as high-stressed (HIGHS) or 
      low-stressed (LOWS) according to the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire. 
      Cardiovascular reactivity and gut dysfunction were studied along with cortisol, 
      zonulin and cytokines. Gut permeability was shown to be affected within one hour 
      after the psychosocial stress induction, and shown to be dependent on age. 
      Interleukin-6 increased with time, most pronounced at the end of the one-hour 
      recovery after V-TSST, and was positively correlated to age. HIGHS experienced 
      more abdominal dysfunction compared to LOWS. In conclusion, this study is the 
      first to show fluctuations in gut permeability after psychosocial stress 
      induction. This was partly associated with changes in inflammatory markers.

      SETTING: This study was conducted at the National Fire Service Academy, 
      Cheonan-si, Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Emergency medical technicians (39 men and 9 
      women) attending the National Fire Service Academy for clinical training with ≥6 
      months field experience or having performed ≥10 CPR. Individuals who withdrew 
      consent were excluded. OUTCOME MEASURES: CPR quality parameters (eg, chest 
      compression depth and its variability). RESULTS: Chest compressions were 
      performed for 8 min each in a stationary and driving state. The mean chest 
      compression depths were 54.8 mm and 55.3 mm during these two states, respectively 
      (p=0.41). The SD of the chest compression depth was significantly higher while in 
      the driving (7.6 mm) than in the stationary state (6.5 mm; p=0.04). The 
      compression depths in the speed bump and sudden stop sections were 51.5 mm and 
      50.6 mm, respectively, which was shallower than those in all other sections 
      (p<0.001). The correct hand position rate was low in the speed bump, sudden stop 
      and right-hand cornering sections (65.4%, 71.5% and 72.5%, respectively; p=0.001) 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although we found no differences in chest compression quality 
      parameters between the stationary and driving states, the variability in the 
      chest compression depth increased in the driving state. When comparing CPR 
      quality parameters according to driving patterns, we noted a shallower 
      compression depth, increased variability and decreased correct hand position rate 
      in the speed bump, sudden stop and right-hand cornering sections. The clinical 
      significance of these changes in CPR quality during ambulance transport remains 
      to be determined. Future studies on how to reduce changes in the quality of CPR 
      (including research on equipment development) are needed.

TI  - The effect of virtual reality-based balance training on motor learning and 
      postural control in healthy adults: a randomized preliminary study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with sedentary lifestyles seem to face a higher risk of 
      falling in their later years. Several causes, such as impairment of strength, 
      coordination, and cognitive function, influence worsening health conditions, 
      including balancing ability. Many modalities can be applied to improve the 
      balance function and prevent falling. Several studies have also recorded the 
      effects of balance training in elderly adults for fall prevention. Accordingly, 
      the aim of this study is to define the effect of virtual reality-based balance 
      training on motor learning and postural control abilities in healthy adults. 
      METHODS: For this study, ten subjects were randomly allocated into either the 
      conventional exercise (CON) or the virtual reality (VR) group. The CON group 
      underwent physical balance training, while the VR group used the virtual reality 
      system 4 weeks. In the VR group, the scores from three game modes were utilized 
      to describe the effect of motor learning and define the learning curves that were 
      derived with the power law function. Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was performed to 
      analyze the postural control in five standing tasks, and data were collected with 
      the help of a force plate. RESULTS: The average score was used to describe the 
      effect of motor learning by deriving the mathematical models for determining the 
      learning curve. Additionally, the models were classified into two exponential 
      functions that relied on the aim and requirement skills. A negative exponential 
      function was observed in the game mode, which requires the cognitive-motor 
      function. In contrast, a positive exponential function was found in the game with 
      use of only the motor skill. Moreover, this curve and its model were also used to 
      describe the effect of learning in the long term and the ratio of difficulty in 
      each game. In the balance performance, there was a significant decrease in the 
      center of pressure parameters in the VR group, while in the CON group, there was 
      a significant increase in the parameters during some foot placements, especially 
      in the medio-lateral direction. CONCLUSION: The proposed VR-based training relies 
      on the effect of motor learning in long-term training though different kinds of 
      task training. In postural analysis, both exercise programs are emphasized to 
      improve the balance ability in healthy adults. However, the virtual reality 
      system can promote better outcomes to improve postural control post exercising.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is lifesaving. Yet, cardiac 
      arrest survival remains low despite CPR intervention. Education has been 
      highlighted as a strategy to overcome this issue. Virtual Reality technology has 
      been gaining momentum in the field of clinical education. Published studies 
      report benefits of virtual reality for CPR education; yet, perceptions of CPR 
      instructors towards virtual reality remain unexplored. CPR instructors are key 
      stakeholders in CPR education and their perceptions are valuable for the design 
      and adoption of virtual reality-enhanced learning. The purpose of this study is 
      therefore to understand the perceptions of CPR instructors towards using virtual 
      reality for health professionals' CPR education. The aim was addressed via three 
      research questions: (1) What are the perceptions of CPR instructors towards 
      current health professionals' CPR education? (2) What are the perceptions of CPR 
      instructors towards features of virtual reality ideal for health professionals' 
      CPR education? (3) What are the perceptions of CPR instructors towards the 
      potential role of virtual reality in health professionals' CPR education? 
      METHODS: A total of 30 CPR instructors were surveyed on their views towards 
      current health professionals' CPR education and the use of virtual reality for 
      health professionals' CPR education, before and after interacting with a CPR 
      virtual reality simulation. Responses were analysed using interpretative thematic 
      analysis. RESULTS: CPR instructors perceived current health professionals' CPR 
      education as limited due to unideal test preparation (resources, practice, 
      motivation, and frame of mind) and performance. They perceived fidelity, 
      engagement, resource conservation, and memory enhancement as features of virtual 
      reality ideal for health professionals' CPR education. Virtual reality was viewed 
      by CPR instructors as having potential as a blended learning tool, targeting both 
      'novice' and 'experienced' health professionals. CONCLUSION: The study 
      highlighted the gaps in current health professionals' CPR education that can be 
      addressed using virtual-reality-enabled learning. Future research could 
      investigate virtual reality simulations with features desirable for CPR education 
      of target populations.

AB  - Affective Computing has emerged as an important field of study that aims to 
      develop systems that can automatically recognize emotions. Up to the present, 
      elicitation has been carried out with non-immersive stimuli. This study, on the 
      other hand, aims to develop an emotion recognition system for affective states 
      evoked through Immersive Virtual Environments. Four alternative virtual rooms 
      were designed to elicit four possible arousal-valence combinations, as described 
      in each quadrant of the Circumplex Model of Affects. An experiment involving the 
      recording of the electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) of 
      sixty participants was carried out. A set of features was extracted from these 
      signals using various state-of-the-art metrics that quantify brain and 
      cardiovascular linear and nonlinear dynamics, which were input into a Support 
      Vector Machine classifier to predict the subject's arousal and valence 
      perception. The model's accuracy was 75.00% along the arousal dimension and 
      71.21% along the valence dimension. Our findings validate the use of Immersive 
      Virtual Environments to elicit and automatically recognize different emotional 
      states from neural and cardiac dynamics; this development could have novel 
      applications in fields as diverse as Architecture, Health, Education and 
      Videogames.

TI  - Training of clinical reasoning with a Serious Game versus small-group 
      problem-based learning: A prospective study.
PG  - e0203851
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0203851 [doi]
LID - e0203851
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Serious Games are increasingly being used in undergraduate medical 
      education. They are usually intended to enhance learning with a focus on 
      knowledge acquisition and skills development. According to the current 
      literature, few studies have assessed their effectiveness regarding clinical 
      reasoning (CR). The aim of this prospective study was to compare a Serious Game, 
      the virtual Accident & Emergency department 'EMERGE' to small-group problem-based 
      learning (PBL) regarding student learning outcome on clinical reasoning in the 
      short term. METHODS: A total of 112 final-year medical students self-selected to 
      participate in ten 90-minute sessions of either small-group PBL or playing 
      EMERGE. CR was assessed in a formative examination consisting of six key feature 
      cases and a final 45-minute EMERGE session. RESULTS: Overall, the EMERGE group (n 
      = 78) scored significantly higher than the PBL group (n = 34) in the key feature 
      examination (62.5 (IQR: 17.7)% vs. 54.2 (IQR: 21.9)%; p = 0.015). There was no 
      significant difference in performance levels between groups regarding those cases 
      which had been discussed in both instructional formats during the training phase. 
      In the final EMERGE session, the EMERGE group achieved significantly better 
      results than the PBL group in all four cases regarding the total score as well as 
      in three of four cases regarding the final diagnosis and the correct therapeutic 
      interventions. CONCLUSION: EMERGE can be used effectively for CR training in 
      undergraduate medical education. The difference in key feature exam scores was 
      driven by additional exposure to more cases in EMERGE compared to PBL despite 
      identical learning time in both instructional formats. EMERGE is a potential 
      alternative to intensive small-group teaching. Further work is needed to 
      establish how Serious Games enhance CR most effectively.

      near-infrared images.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The development of biometric identification technology 
      and intelligent medication has enabled researchers to analyze subcutaneous veins 
      from near-infrared images. However, the stereo reconstruction of subcutaneous 
      veins has not been well studied, and the results are difficult to utilize in 
      clinical practice. METHODS: We present a hybrid constraint optimization (HCO) 
      matching algorithm for vein reconstruction to solve the matching failure problems 
      caused by the incomplete segmentation of vein structures captured from different 
      views. This algorithm initially introduces the existence of the epipolar and 
      homography constraints in the subcutaneous vein matching. Then, the HCO matching 
      algorithm of the vascular centerline is established by homography point-to-point 
      matching, homography matrix optimization, and vascular section matching. Finally, 
      the 3D subcutaneous vein is reconstructed on the basis of the principle of 
      triangulation and system calibration parameters. RESULTS: To validate the 
      performance of the proposed matching method, we designed a series of experiments 
      to evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid constraint optimization method. The 
      experiments were performed on simulated and real datasets. 42 real vascular 
      images were analyzed on the basis of different matching strategies. Experimental 
      result shows that the matching accuracy increased significantly with the proposed 
      optimization matching method. To calculate the reconstruction accuracy, we 
      reconstructed seven simulated cardboards and measured 10 vascular distances in 
      each simulated cardboard. The average vascular distance error of each simulated 
      image was within 1.0 mm, and the distance errors of 75% feature points were less 
      than 1.5 mm. Also, we printed a 3D simulated vein model to improve the 
      illustration of this system. The reconstruction error extends from -3.58 mm to 
      1.94 mm with a standard deviation of 0.68 mm and a mean of 0.07 mm. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The algorithm is validated in terms of homography optimization, matching 
      efficiency, and simulated vascular reconstruction error. The experimental results 
      demonstrate that the veins captured from the left and right views can be 
      accurately matched through the proposed algorithm.

LID - 2343
AB  - We present the architecture and usability evaluation of virtual reality 
      system-"Positive Bike"-designed for improving cognitive and motor conditions in 
      frail elderly patients. The system consists of a cycle-ergometer integrated in an 
      immersive virtual reality system (CAVE) which allows combining motor and 
      cognitive exercises according to a "dual-task" paradigm. We tested the usability 
      and user's experience of the prototype in a pilot evaluation study that involved 
      five elderly patients. The prototype was tested in one-session training to 
      understand the limitations and areas for improvement of our system. The 
      evaluation consisted in (i) usability assessment using the system usability 
      scale; (ii) evaluation of user's engagement using the flow state scale; and (iii) 
      expert evaluation involving interviews with domain experts. Results showed a good 
      usability, both for system usability scale and the semi-structured interview. The 
      level of flow (i.e., enjoyment with the task at hand) measured using the short 
      flow state scale, was also high. Analysis of semi-structured interview carried 
      out with domain experts provided further indications to improve the system. 
      Overall, these findings show that, despite some limitations, the system is usable 
      and provides an enjoyable user's experience.

AB  - Orthopaedic training has followed an apprentice/mentorship pathway of training 
      throughout its history. This method of training is entrenched in Medicine and is 
      the foundation for our current residency/fellowship method of attaining the 
      appropriate training and credentialing of physicians and surgeons to safely care 
      for our patients. Over the past 2 decades, the use of proficiency-based training 
      has been shown to be effective in general surgery, cardiac surgery, vascular and 
      plastic surgery, and now with the Copernicus project, in shoulder arthroscopy. 
      Combining proficiency-based training with the rapid advances in virtual reality 
      technology will allow surgeons to become competent with the surgical skills 
      needed for surgery before ever touching a patient.

AB  - Current imaging technologies are capable of acquiring volumetric data, but they 
      are limited by the flat 2-dimensional representation of complex 3-dimensional 
      data. This pictorial report illustrates the potential role of interactive virtual 
      reality (VR) that enables physicians to visualize and interact with image data as 
      if they were real physical objects. Increasing availability of tools that make 
      the VR environment a possibility could potentially be valuable in the 
      interventional radiology suite.

AB  - Recently, rapid development in the mobile computing arena has allowed extended 
      reality technologies to achieve performance levels that remove longstanding 
      barriers to medical adoption. Importantly, head-mounted displays have become 
      untethered and are light enough to be worn for extended periods of time, 
      see-through displays allow the user to remain in his or her environment while 
      interacting with digital content, and processing power has allowed displays to 
      keep up with human perception to prevent motion sickness. Across cardiology, many 
      groups are taking advantage of these advances for education, pre-procedural 
      planning, intraprocedural visualization, and patient rehabilitation. Here, 
      we detail these applications and the advances that have made them possible.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Virtual reality (VR) allows users to experience realistic, immersive 
      3D virtual environments with the depth perception and binocular field of view of 
      real 3D settings. Newer VR technology has now allowed for interaction with 3D 
      objects within these virtual environments through the use of VR controllers. This 
      technical note describes our preliminary experience with VR as an adjunct tool to 
      traditional angiographic imaging in the preprocedural workup of a patient with a 
      complex pseudoaneurysm. METHODS: Angiographic MRI data was imported and segmented 
      to create 3D meshes of bilateral carotid vasculature. The 3D meshes were then 
      projected into VR space, allowing the operator to inspect the carotid vasculature 
      using a 3D VR headset as well as interact with the pseudoaneurysm (handling, 
      rotation, magnification, and sectioning) using two VR controllers. RESULTS: 3D 
      segmentation of a complex pseudoaneurysm in the distal cervical segment of the 
      right internal carotid artery was successfully performed and projected into VR. 
      Conventional and VR visualization modes were equally effective in identifying and 
      classifying the pathology. VR visualization allowed the operators to manipulate 
      the dataset to achieve a greater understanding of the anatomy of the parent 
      vessel, the angioarchitecture of the pseudoaneurysm, and the surface contours of 
      all visualized structures. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study demonstrates the 
      feasibility of utilizing VR for preprocedural evaluation in patients with 
      anatomically complex neurovascular disorders. This novel visualization approach 
      may serve as a valuable adjunct tool in deciding patient-specific treatment plans 
      and selection of devices prior to intervention.

TI  - Role of virtual reality in congenital heart disease.
PG  - 357-361
LID - 10.1111/chd.12587 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: New platforms for patient imaging present opportunities for improved 
      surgical planning in complex congenital heart disease (CHD). Virtual reality (VR) 
      allows for interactive manipulation of high-resolution representations of 
      patient-specific imaging data, as a supplement to traditional 2D visualizations 
      and 3D printed heart models. DESIGN: We present the novel use of VR for the 
      presurgical planning of cardiac surgery in two infants with complex CHD to 
      demonstrate interactive real-time views of complex intra and extracardiac 
      anatomy. RESULTS: The use of VR for cardiac presurgical planning is feasible 
      using existing imaging data. The software was evaluated by both pediatric cardiac 
      surgeons and pediatric cardiologists, and felt to be reliable and operated with a 
      very short learning curve. CONCLUSIONS: VR with controller-based interactive 
      capability allows for interactive viewing of 3D models with complex intra and 
      extracardiac anatomy. This serves as a useful complement to traditional 
      preoperative planning methods in terms of its potential for group based 
      collaborative discussion, user defined illustrative views, cost-effectiveness, 
      and facility of use.

TI  - Can virtual autopsy with postmortem CT improve clinical diagnosis of cause of 
      death? A retrospective observational cohort study in a Dutch tertiary referral

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether virtual autopsy with postmortem CT (PMCT) 
      improves clinical diagnosis of the immediate cause of death. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective observational cohort study. INCLUSION CRITERIA: inhospital and 
      out-of-hospital deaths over the age of 1 year in whom virtual autopsy with PMCT 
      and conventional autopsy were performed. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: forensic cases, 
      postmortal organ donors and cases with incomplete scanning procedures. Cadavers 
      were examined by virtual autopsy with PMCT prior to conventional autopsy. The 
      clinically determined cause of death was recorded before virtual autopsy and was 
      then adjusted with the findings of virtual autopsy. Using conventional autopsy as 
      reference standard, we investigated the increase in sensitivity for immediate 
      cause of death, type of pathology and anatomical system involved before and after 
      virtual autopsy. SETTING: Tertiary referral centre. PARTICIPANTS: 86 cadavers 
      that underwent conventional and virtual autopsy between July 2012 and June 2016. 
      INTERVENTION: PMCT consisted of brain, cervical spine and chest-abdomen-pelvis 
      imaging. Conventional autopsy consisted of thoracoabdominal examination 
      with/without brain autopsy. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Increase in 
      sensitivity for the immediate cause of death, type of pathology (infection, 
      haemorrhage, perfusion disorder, other or not assigned) and anatomical system 
      (pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, other or not assigned) involved, 
      before and after virtual autopsy. RESULTS: Using PMCT, the sensitivity for 
      immediate cause of death increased with 12% (95% CI 2% to 22%) from 53% (41% to 
      64%) to 64% (53% to 75%), with 18% (9% to 27%) from 65% (54% to 76%) to 83% (73% 
      to 91%) for type of pathology and with 19% (9% to 30%) from 65% (54% to 76%) to 
      85% (75% to 92%) for anatomical system. CONCLUSION: While unenhanced PMCT is an 
      insufficient substitute for conventional autopsy, it can improve diagnosis of 
      cause of death over clinical diagnosis alone and should therefore be considered 
      whenever autopsy is not performed.

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyse the effect of a six-month home-based phase III cardiac 
      rehabilitation (CR) specific exercise program, performed in a virtual reality 
      (Kinect) or conventional (booklet) environment, on executive function, quality of 
      life and depression, anxiety and stress of subjects with coronary artery disease. 
      METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with subjects, who had 
      completed phase II, randomly assigned to intervention group 1 (IG1), whose 
      program encompassed the use of Kinect (n = 11); or intervention group 2 (IG2), a 
      paper booklet (n = 11); or a control group (CG), only subjected to the usual care 
      (n = 11). The three groups received education on cardiovascular risk factors. The 
      assessed parameters, at baseline (M0), 3 (M1) and 6 months (M2), were executive 
      function, control and integration in the implementation of an adequate behaviour 
      in relation to a certain objective, specifically the ability to switch 
      information (Trail Making Test), working memory (Verbal Digit Span test), and 
      selective attention and conflict resolution ability (Stroop test), quality of 
      life (MacNew questionnaire) and depression, anxiety and stress (Depression, 
      Anxiety and Stress Scale 21). Descriptive and inferential statistical measures 
      were used, significance level was set at .05. RESULTS: The IG1 revealed 
      significant improvements, in the selective attention and conflict resolution 
      ability, in comparison with the CG in the variable difference M0 - M2 (p = .021) 
      and in comparison with the IG2 in the variable difference M1 - M2 and M0 - M2 
      (p = .001 and p = .002, respectively). No significant differences were found in 
      the quality of life, and depression, anxiety and stress. CONCLUSIONS: The virtual 
      reality format had improved selective attention and conflict resolution ability, 
      revealing the potential of CR, specifically with virtual reality exercise, on 
      executive function. Implications for Rehabilitation In cardiac rehabilitation, 
      especially in phase III, it is important to develop and to present alternative 
      strategies, as virtual reality using the Kinect in a home context. Taking into 
      account the relationship between the improvement of the executive function with 
      physical exercise, it is relevant to access the impact of a cardiac 
      rehabilitation program on the executive function. Enhancing the value of the 
      phase III of cardiac rehabilitation.

TI  - Functional performance comparison between real and virtual tasks in older adults: 
      A cross-sectional study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ageing is usually accompanied by deterioration of physical 
      abilities, such as muscular strength, sensory sensitivity, and functional 
      capacity, making chronic diseases, and the well-being of older adults new 
      challenges to global public health. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to 
      evaluate whether a task practiced in a virtual environment could promote better 
      performance and enable transfer to the same task in a real environment. METHOD: 
      The study evaluated 65 older adults of both genders, aged 60 to 82 years 
      (M = 69.6, SD = 6.3). A timing coincident task was applied to measure the 
      perceptual-motor ability to perform a motor response. The participants were 
      divided into 2 groups: started in a real interface and started in a virtual 
      interface. RESULTS: All subjects improved their performance during the practice, 
      but improvement was not observed for the real interface, as the participants were 
      near maximum performance from the beginning of the task. However, there was no 
      transfer of performance from the virtual to real environment or vice versa. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The virtual environment was shown to provide improvement of 
      performance with a short-term motor learning protocol in a timing coincident 
      task. This result suggests that the practice of tasks in a virtual environment 
      seems to be a promising tool for the assessment and training of healthy older 
      adults, even though there was no transfer of performance to a real environment.

TI  - VCSim3: a VR simulator for cardiovascular interventions.
PG  - 135-149
LID - 10.1007/s11548-017-1679-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Effective and safe performance of cardiovascular interventions requires 
      excellent catheter/guidewire manipulation skills. These skills are currently 
      mainly gained through an apprenticeship on real patients, which may not be safe 
      or cost-effective. Computer simulation offers an alternative for core skills 
      training. However, replicating the physical behaviour of real instruments 
      navigated through blood vessels is a challenging task. METHODS: We have developed 
      VCSim3-a virtual reality simulator for cardiovascular interventions. The 
      simulator leverages an inextensible Cosserat rod to model virtual catheters and 
      guidewires. Their mechanical properties were optimized with respect to their real 
      counterparts scanned in a silicone phantom using X-ray CT imaging. The 
      instruments are manipulated via a VSP haptic device. Supporting solutions such as 
      fluoroscopic visualization, contrast flow propagation, cardiac motion, balloon 
      inflation, and stent deployment, enable performing a complete angioplasty 
      procedure. RESULTS: We present detailed results of simulation accuracy of the 
      virtual instruments, along with their computational performance. In addition, the 
      results of a preliminary face and content validation study conveyed on a group of 
      17 interventional radiologists are given. CONCLUSIONS: VR simulation of 
      cardiovascular procedure can contribute to surgical training and improve the 
      educational experience without putting patients at risk, raising ethical issues 
      or requiring expensive animal or cadaver facilities. VCSim3 is still a prototype, 
      yet the initial results indicate that it provides promising foundations for 
      further development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The authors have published their design of a pulsatile fresh frozen 
      human cadaver circulation model (PHCM) for endovascular training the face 
      validity of the PHCM for training endovascular practitioners was subsequently 
      assessed. METHODS: Twelve endovascular clinicians performed the same 2 procedures 
      (catheterization of the left renal artery and left subclavian artery) on PHCM and 
      Simbionix angiomentor virtual reality simulator (SVR). They were randomized to 
      begin on either the PHCM or SVR. A pretrial questionnaire determined 
      participants' endovascular experience. After training, participants rated 
      statements relating to their experience on a numerical scale from 1 to 5, with 1 
      representing the strongest agreement with the statement. RESULTS: When 
      participants were asked to compare the realism of training modalities with live 
      patients, PHCM scored significantly higher than SVR on statements regarding 
      "realism of vascular access" (P = 0.002), "guide-wire manipulation" (P = 0.001), 
      and "vessel catheterization" (P = 0.004). Candidates again favored PHCM as "a 
      valuable learning exercise" (P = 0.016) and strongly favored PHCM as a "useful 
      training model" compared to SVR (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first 
      published trial in world literature to assess the validity of a PHCM for training 
      endovascular practitioners. The PHCM demonstrates good face validity when 
      compared to both real patients and the SVR model and holds exciting potential.

AB  - The evolution of information and communication technologies has deeply impacted 
      education reform, promoted the development of digital-learning models, and 
      stimulated the development of diverse nursing education strategies in order to 
      better fulfill needs and expand in new directions. The present paper introduces 
      the intelligent-learning resources that are available for basic medical science 
      education, problem-based learning, nursing scenario-based learning, objective 
      structured clinical examinations, and other similar activities in the Department 
      of Nursing at Chang Gung University of Science and Technology. The program is 
      offered in two parts: specialized classroom facilities and cloud computing / 
      mobile-learning. The latter includes high-fidelity simulation classrooms, online 
      e-books, and virtual interactive simulation and augmented reality mobile-learning 
      materials, which are provided through multimedia technology development, learning 
      management systems, web-certificated examinations, and automated teaching and 
      learning feedback mechanisms. It is expected that the teaching experiences that 
      are shared in this article may be used as a reference for applying professional 
      wisdom teaching models into nursing education.

TI  - Serious game versus online course for pretraining medical students before a 
      simulation-based mastery learning course on cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A 
      randomised controlled study.
PG  - 836-844
LID - 10.1097/EJA.0000000000000675 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although both recorded lectures and serious games have been used to 
      pretrain health professionals before simulation training on cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation, they have never been compared. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study 
      was to compare an online course and a serious game for pretraining medical 
      students before simulation-based mastery learning on the management of sudden 
      cardiac arrest. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial. Participants were 
      pretrained using the online course or the serious game on day 1 and day 7. On day 
      8, each participant was evaluated repeatedly on a scenario of cardiac arrest 
      until reaching a minimum passing score. SETTING: Department of Simulation in 
      Healthcare in a French medical faculty. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-two volunteer 
      second-year medical students participated between June and October 2016 and 79 
      were assessed for primary outcome. INTERVENTIONS: The serious game used was 
      Staying Alive, which involved a 3D realistic environment, and the online course 
      involved a PowerPoint lecture. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The median total training 
      time needed for students to reach the minimum passing score on day 8. This same 
      outcome was also assessed 4 months later. RESULTS: The median training time 
      (interquartile range) necessary for students to reach the minimum passing score 
      was similar between the two groups: 20.5 (15.8 to 30.3) minutes in the serious 
      game group versus 23 (15 to 32) minutes in the online course group, P = 0.51. 
      Achieving an appropriate degree of chest compression was the most difficult 
      requirement to fulfil for students in both groups. Four months later, the median 
      training time decreased significantly in both groups, but no correlation was 
      found at an individual level with the training times observed on day 8. 
      CONCLUSION: The serious game used in this study was not superior to an online 
      course to pretrain medical students in the management of a cardiac arrest. The 
      absence of any correlation between the performances of students evaluated during 
      two training sessions separated by 4 months suggests that some elements in the 
      management of cardiac arrest such as compression depth can only be partially 
      learned and retained after a simulation-based training. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov-NCT02758119.

TI  - Integrating light-sheet imaging with virtual reality to recapitulate 
      developmental cardiac mechanics.
LID - 97180 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.97180 [doi]
LID - e97180
AB  - Currently, there is a limited ability to interactively study developmental 
      cardiac mechanics and physiology. We therefore combined light-sheet fluorescence 
      microscopy (LSFM) with virtual reality (VR) to provide a hybrid platform for 3D 
      architecture and time-dependent cardiac contractile function characterization. By 
      taking advantage of the rapid acquisition, high axial resolution, low 
      phototoxicity, and high fidelity in 3D and 4D (3D spatial + 1D time or spectra), 
      this VR-LSFM hybrid methodology enables interactive visualization and 
      quantification otherwise not available by conventional methods, such as routine 
      optical microscopes. We hereby demonstrate multiscale applicability of VR-LSFM to 
      (a) interrogate skin fibroblasts interacting with a hyaluronic acid-based 
      hydrogel, (b) navigate through the endocardial trabecular network during 
      zebrafish development, and (c) localize gene therapy-mediated potassium channel 
      expression in adult murine hearts. We further combined our batch intensity 
      normalized segmentation algorithm with deformable image registration to interface 
      a VR environment with imaging computation for the analysis of cardiac 
      contraction. Thus, the VR-LSFM hybrid platform demonstrates an efficient and 
      robust framework for creating a user-directed microenvironment in which we 
      uncovered developmental cardiac mechanics and physiology with high spatiotemporal 
      resolution.

TI  - Applying lessons from social psychology to transform the culture of error 
      disclosure.
PG  - 996-1001
LID - 10.1111/medu.13345 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The ability to carry out prompt and effective error disclosure has been 
      described in the literature as an essential skill among physicians that can lead 
      to improved patient satisfaction, staff well-being and hospital outcomes. 
      However, few studies have addressed the social psychology principles that may 
      influence physician behaviour. METHODS: The authors provide an overview of recent 
      administrative measures designed to encourage physicians to disclose error, but 
      note that deliberate practice, buttressed with lessons from social psychology, is 
      needed to implement further productive behavioural changes. RESULTS: Two main 
      cognitive biases that may hinder error disclosure are identified, namely: 
      fundamental attribution error, and forecasting error. Strategies to overcome 
      these maladaptive cognitive patterns are discussed. The authors note that 
      interactions with standardised patients (SPs) can be used to simulate hospital 
      encounters and help teach important behavioural considerations. Virtual reality 
      is introduced as an immersive, realistic and easily scalable technology that can 
      supplement traditional curricula. Lastly, the authors highlight the importance of 
      establishing a professional standard of competence, potentially by incorporating 
      difficult patient encounters, including disclosure of error, into medical 
      licensing examinations that assess clinical skills. CONCLUSIONS: Existing 
      curricula that cover physician error disclosure may benefit from reviewing the 
      social psychology literature. These lessons, incorporated into SP programmes and 
      emerging technological platforms, may improve training and evaluative methods for 
      all medical trainees.

TI  - Standardized Measurement of Sensorimotor Recovery in Stroke Trials: 
      Consensus-Based Core Recommendations from the Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation 
      Roundtable.
PG  - 784-792
LID - 10.1177/1545968317732662 [doi]
AB  - Finding, testing and demonstrating efficacy of new treatments for stroke recovery 
      is a multifaceted challenge. We believe that to advance the field, 
      neurorehabilitation trials need a conceptually rigorous starting framework. An 
      essential first step is to agree on definitions of sensorimotor recovery and on 
      measures consistent with these definitions. Such standardization would allow 
      pooling of participant data across studies and institutions aiding meta-analyses 
      of completed trials, more detailed exploration of recovery profiles of our 
      patients and the generation of new hypotheses. Here, we present the results of a 
      consensus meeting about measurement standards and patient characteristics that we 
      suggest should be collected in all future stroke recovery trials. Recommendations 
      are made considering time post stroke and are aligned with the international 
      classification of functioning and disability. A strong case is made for addition 
      of kinematic and kinetic movement quantification. Further work is being 
      undertaken by our group to form consensus on clinical predictors and pre-stroke 
      clinical data that should be collected, as well as recommendations for additional 
      outcome measurement tools. To improve stroke recovery trials, we urge the 
      research community to consider adopting our recommendations in their trial 
      design.

AB  - Three synthetic datasets - of observation size 15,000, 155,000 and 1,555,000 
      participants, respectively - were created by simulating eleven cardiac and 
      anthropometric variables from nine collection ages of the ALSAPC birth cohort 
      study. The synthetic datasets retain similar data properties to the ALSPAC study 
      data they are simulated from (co-variance matrices, as well as the mean and 
      variance values of the variables) without including the original data itself or 
      disclosing participant information.  In this instance, the three synthetic 
      datasets have been utilised in an academia-industry collaboration to build a 
      prototype virtual reality data analysis software, but they could have a broader 
      use in method and software development projects where sensitive data cannot be 
      freely shared.

TI  - Application and outcomes of therapy combining transcranial direct current 
      stimulation and virtual reality: a systematic review.
PG  - 551-559
LID - 10.1080/17483107.2016.1230152 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the methods and major outcomes of transcranial direct 
      current stimulation (tDCS) combined with virtual reality (VR) therapy in 
      randomized controlled trials. METHOD: A systematic review was performed following 
      PRISMA guidelines using PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science and CAPES periodic 
      databases, with no time restriction. The studies were screened for the following 
      inclusion criteria: human subjects, combination of VR and tDCS methods, and 
      randomized controlled study design. All potentially relevant articles were 
      independently reviewed by two researchers, who reached a consensus on which 
      articles met the inclusion criteria. The PEDro scale was used to evaluate the 
      studies. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included, all of which utilized a variety 
      of tDCS and VR application methods. The main outcomes were found to be beneficial 
      in intervention groups of different populations, including improvements in body 
      sway, gait, stroke recovery, pain management and vegetative reactions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of tDCS combined with VR showed positive results in both 
      healthy and impaired patients. Future studies with larger sample sizes and 
      homogeneous participants are required to confirm the benefits of tDCS and VR. 
      Implications for Rehabilitation tDCS with VR intervention can be an alternative 
      to traditional rehabilitation programs. tDCS with VR is a promising type of 
      intervention with a variety of positive effects. Application of tDCS with VR is 
      appropriated to both healthy and impaired patients. There is no consensus of tDCS 
      with VR application.

TI  - A Novel Virtual Reality-Based Training Protocol for the Enhancement of the 
      "Mental Frame Syncing" in Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease: A 
      Development-of-Concept Trial.
PG  - 240
LID - 10.3389/fnagi.2017.00240 [doi]
LID - 240
AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that people with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
      show compromised spatial abilities. In addition, there exists from the earliest 
      stages of AD a specific impairment in "mental frame syncing," which is the 
      ability to synchronize an allocentric viewpoint-independent representation 
      (including object-to-object information) with an egocentric one by computing the 
      bearing of each relevant "object" in the environment in relation to the stored 
      heading in space (i.e., information about our viewpoint contained in the 
      allocentric viewpoint-dependent representation). The main objective of this 
      development-of-concept trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel VR-based 
      training protocol focused on the enhancement of the "mental frame syncing" of the 
      different spatial representations in subjects with AD. We recruited 20 
      individuals with AD who were randomly assigned to either "VR-based training" or 
      "Control Group." Moreover, eight cognitively healthy elderly individuals were 
      recruited to participate in the VR-based training in order to have a different 
      comparison group. Based on a neuropsychological assessment, our results indicated 
      a significant improvement in long-term spatial memory after the VR-based training 
      for patients with AD; this means that transference of improvements from the 
      VR-based training to more general aspects of spatial cognition was observed. 
      Interestingly, there was also a significant effect of VR-based training on 
      executive functioning for cognitively healthy elderly individuals. In sum, VR 
      could be considered as an advanced embodied tool suitable for treating spatial 
      recall impairments.

TI  - Baroreflex dysfunction and augmented sympathetic nerve responses during mental 
      stress in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.
PG  - 4893-4908
LID - 10.1113/JP274269 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at a 
      significantly higher risk of developing hypertension and cardiovascular disease. 
      The mechanisms underlying this increased risk are not known. Studies have 
      suggested that PTSD patients have an overactive sympathetic nervous system (SNS) 
      that could contribute to cardiovascular risk; however, sympathetic function has 
      not previously been rigorously evaluated in PTSD patients. Using direct 
      measurements of sympathetic nerve activity and pharmacological manipulation of 
      blood pressure, we show that veterans with PTSD have augmented SNS and 
      haemodynamic reactivity during both combat-related and non-combat related mental 
      stress, impaired sympathetic and cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity, and 
      increased inflammation. Identifying the mechanisms contributing to increased 
      cardiovascular (CV) risk in PTSD will pave the way for developing interventions 
      to improve sympathetic function and reduce CV risk in these patients. ABSTRACT: 
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased cardiovascular 
      (CV) risk. We tested the hypothesis that PTSD patients have augmented sympathetic 
      nervous system (SNS) and haemodynamic reactivity during mental stress, as well as 
      impaired arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). Fourteen otherwise healthy 
      Veterans with combat-related PTSD were compared with 14 matched Controls without 
      PTSD.  Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), continuous blood pressure (BP) 
      and electrocardiography were measured at baseline, as well as during two types of 
      mental stress:  combat-related mental stress using virtual reality combat 
      exposure (VRCE) and non-combat related stress using mental arithmetic (MA). A 
      cold pressor test (CPT) was administered for comparison. BRS was tested using 
      pharmacological manipulation of BP via the Modified Oxford technique at rest and 
      during VRCE. Blood samples were analysed for inflammatory biomarkers. Baseline 
      characteristics, MSNA and haemodynamics were similar between the groups. In PTSD 
      vs. Controls, MSNA (+8.2 ± 1.0 vs. +1.2 ± 1.3 bursts min(-1) , P < 0.001) and 
      heart rate responses (+3.2 ± 1.1 vs. -2.3 ± 1.0 beats min(-1) , P = 0.003) were 
      significantly augmented during VRCE.  Similarly, in PTSD vs. Controls, MSNA 
      (+21.0 ± 2.6 vs. +6.7 ± 1.5 bursts min(-1) , P < 0.001) and diastolic BP 
      responses (+6.3 ± 1.0 vs. +3.5 ± 1.0 mmHg, P = 0.011) were significantly 
      augmented during MA but not during CPT (P = not significant). In the PTSD group, 
      sympathetic BRS (-1.2 ± 0.2 vs. -2.0 ± 0.3 burst incidence mmHg(-1) , P = 0.026) 
      and cardiovagal BRS (9.5 ± 1.4 vs. 23.6 ± 4.3 ms mmHg(-1) , P = 0.008) were 
      significantly blunted at rest. PTSD patients had significantly higher highly 
      sensitive-C-reactive protein levels compared to Controls (2.1 ± 0.4 vs. 
      1.0 ± 0.3 mg L(-1) , P = 0.047). Augmented SNS and haemodynamic responses to 
      mental stress, blunted BRS and inflammation may contribute to an increased CV 
      risk in PTSD.

TI  - Standardized measurement of sensorimotor recovery in stroke trials: 
      Consensus-based core recommendations from the Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation 
      Roundtable.
PG  - 451-461
LID - 10.1177/1747493017711813 [doi]
AB  - Finding, testing and demonstrating efficacy of new treatments for stroke recovery 
      is a multifaceted challenge. We believe that to advance the field, 
      neurorehabilitation trials need a conceptually rigorous starting framework. An 
      essential first step is to agree on definitions of sensorimotor recovery and on 
      measures consistent with these definitions. Such standardization would allow 
      pooling of participant data across studies and institutions aiding meta-analyses 
      of completed trials, more detailed exploration of recovery profiles of our 
      patients and the generation of new hypotheses. Here, we present the results of a 
      consensus meeting about measurement standards and patient characteristics that we 
      suggest should be collected in all future stroke recovery trials. Recommendations 
      are made considering time post stroke and are aligned with the international 
      classification of functioning and disability. A strong case is made for addition 
      of kinematic and kinetic movement quantification. Further work is being 
      undertaken by our group to form consensus on clinical predictors and pre-stroke 
      clinical data that should be collected, as well as recommendations for additional 
      outcome measurement tools. To improve stroke recovery trials, we urge the 
      research community to consider adopting our recommendations in their trial 
      design.

TI  - Virtual endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms: models and uncertainty.
LID - 10.1002/wsbm.1385 [doi]
AB  - Virtual endovascular treatment models (VETMs) have been developed with the view 
      to aid interventional neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons to pre-operatively 
      analyze the comparative efficacy and safety of endovascular treatments for 
      intracranial aneurysms. Based on the current state of VETMs in aneurysm rupture 
      risk stratification and in patient-specific prediction of treatment outcomes, we 
      argue there is a need to go beyond personalized biomechanical flow modeling 
      assuming deterministic parameters and error-free measurements. The 
      mechanobiological effects associated with blood clot formation are important 
      factors in therapeutic decision making and models of post-treatment 
      intra-aneurysmal biology and biochemistry should be linked to the purely 
      hemodynamic models to improve the predictive power of current VETMs. The 
      influence of model and parameter uncertainties associated to each component of a 
      VETM is, where feasible, quantified via a random-effects meta-analysis of the 
      literature. This allows estimating the pooled effect size of these uncertainties 
      on aneurysmal wall shear stress. From such meta-analyses, two main sources of 
      uncertainty emerge where research efforts have so far been limited: (1) vascular 
      wall distensibility, and (2) intra/intersubject systemic flow variations. In the 
      future, we suggest that current deterministic computational simulations need to 
      be extended with strategies for uncertainty mitigation, uncertainty exploration, 
      and sensitivity reduction techniques. WIREs Syst Biol Med 2017, 9:e1385. doi:

TI  - Cognitive behavioral therapy to aid weight loss in obese patients: current 
      perspectives.
PG  - 165-173
LID - 10.2147/PRBM.S113278 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is a chronic condition associated with risk factors for many medical 
      complications and comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, some types of 
      cancer, osteoarthritis, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, type-2 
      diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and different psychosocial issues and 
      psychopathological disorders. Obesity is a highly complex, multifactorial 
      disease: genetic, biological, psychological, behavioral, familial, social, 
      cultural, and environmental factors can influence in different ways. 
      Evidence-based strategies to improve weight loss, maintain a healthy weight, and 
      reduce related comorbidities typically integrate different interventions: 
      dietetic, nutritional, physical, behavioral, psychological, and if necessary, 
      pharmacological and surgical ones. Such treatments are implemented in a 
      multidisciplinary context with a clinical team composed of endocrinologists, 
      nutritionists, dietitians, physiotherapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and 
      sometimes surgeons. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is traditionally 
      recognized as the best established treatment for binge eating disorder and the 
      most preferred intervention for obesity, and could be considered as the 
      first-line treatment among psychological approaches, especially in a long-term 
      perspective; however, it does not necessarily produce a successful weight loss. 
      Traditional CBT for weight loss and other protocols, such as enhanced CBT, 
      enhanced focused CBT, behavioral weight loss treatment, therapeutic education, 
      acceptance and commitment therapy, and sequential binge, are discussed in this 
      review. The issue of long-term weight management of obesity, the real challenge 
      in outpatient settings and in lifestyle modification, is discussed taking into 
      account the possible contribution of mHealth and the stepped-care approach in 
      health care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a manufacturing process in which 
      an object is created by specialist printers designed to print in additive layers 
      to create a 3D object. Whilst there are initial promising medical applications of 
      3D printing, a lack of evidence to support its use remains a barrier for larger 
      scale adoption into clinical practice. Endovascular virtual reality (VR) 
      simulation plays an important role in the safe training of future endovascular 
      practitioners, but existing VR models have disadvantages including cost and 
      accessibility which could be addressed with 3D printing. METHODS: This study 
      sought to evaluate the feasibility of 3D printing an anatomically accurate human 
      aorta for the purposes of endovascular training. RESULTS: A 3D printed model was 
      successfully designed and printed and used for endovascular simulation. The 
      stages of development and practical applications are described. Feedback from 96 
      physicians who answered a series of questions using a 5 point Likert scale is 
      presented. CONCLUSIONS: Initial data supports the value of 3D printed 
      endovascular models although further educational validation is required.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) requires a high-level of 
      technical-competency to avoid device-related complications. Virtual reality 
      simulation-based training (SBT) may offer an alternative method of psychomotor 
      skill acquisition; however, its role in EVAR training is undefined. This study 
      aimed to: a) benchmark competency levels using EVAR SBT, and b) investigate the 
      impact of supervised SBT on trainee performance. METHODS: EVAR procedure-related 
      metrics were benchmarked by six experienced consultants using a Simbionix 
      Angiomentor EVAR simulator. Sixteen vascular surgical trainees performing a 
      comparable EVAR before and after structured SBT (>4 teaching sessions) were 
      assessed utilising a modified Likert-scale score. These were benchmarked for 
      comparison against the standard set by the consultant body. RESULTS: Median 
      procedural-time for consultants was 43.5 min (IQR 7.5). A significant improvement 
      in trainee procedural-time following SBT was observed (median procedural time 
      77 min [IQR 20.75] vs. 56 min [IQR: 7.00], p < .0001). The mean (SD) trainee 
      Likert score pre- and post-SBT improved (16.6 [SD 1.455] vs. 28.63 [SD 2.986], 
      p < .0001). Fewer endoleaks were observed (p = .0063) and trainees chose an 
      appropriately sized device more often after SBT. CONCLUSION: This study suggests 
      that EVAR-SBT should be considered as an adjunct to standard psychomotor skill 
      teaching techniques for EVAR within the vascular surgery training curricula.

TI  - Using Xbox kinect motion capture technology to improve clinical rehabilitation 
      outcomes for balance and cardiovascular health in an individual with chronic TBI.
LID - 6 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motion capture virtual reality-based rehabilitation has become more 
      common. However, therapists face challenges to the implementation of virtual 
      reality (VR) in clinical settings. Use of motion capture technology such as the 
      Xbox Kinect may provide a useful rehabilitation tool for the treatment of 
      postural instability and cardiovascular deconditioning in individuals with 
      chronic severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The primary purpose of this study 
      was to evaluate the effects of a Kinect-based VR intervention using commercially 
      available motion capture games on balance outcomes for an individual with chronic 
      TBI. The secondary purpose was to assess the feasibility of this intervention for 
      eliciting cardiovascular adaptations. METHODS: A single system experimental 
      design (n = 1) was utilized, which included baseline, intervention, and retention 
      phases. Repeated measures were used to evaluate the effects of an 8-week 
      supervised exercise intervention using two Xbox One Kinect games. Balance was 
      characterized using the dynamic gait index (DGI), functional reach test (FRT), 
      and Limits of Stability (LOS) test on the NeuroCom Balance Master. The LOS 
      assesses end-point excursion (EPE), maximal excursion (MXE), and directional 
      control (DCL) during weight-shifting tasks. Cardiovascular and activity measures 
      were characterized by heart rate at the end of exercise (HRe), total gameplay 
      time (TAT), and time spent in a therapeutic heart rate (TTR) during the Kinect 
      intervention. Chi-square and ANOVA testing were used to analyze the data. 
      RESULTS: Dynamic balance, characterized by the DGI, increased during the 
      intervention phase χ(2) (1, N = 12) = 12, p = .001. Static balance, characterized 
      by the FRT showed no significant changes. The EPE increased during the 
      intervention phase in the backward direction χ(2) (1, N = 12) = 5.6, p = .02, and 
      notable improvements of DCL were demonstrated in all directions. HRe (F (2,174) = 
      29.65, p = < .001) and time in a TTR (F (2, 12) = 4.19, p = .04) decreased over 
      the course of the intervention phase. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a supervised 
      Kinect-based program that incorporated commercial games improved dynamic balance 
      for an individual post severe TBI. Additionally, moderate cardiovascular activity 
      was achieved through motion capture gaming. Further studies appear warranted to 
      determine the potential therapeutic utility of commercial VR games in this 
      patient population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrial.gov ID - NCT02889289.

TI  - Enhancing Long-Term Motivation of Cardiac Patients by Applying Exergaming in 
      Rehabilitation Training.
PG  - 183-187
AB  - Although regular physical activities reduce mortality and increase quality of 
      life many cardiac patients discontinue training due to lack of motivation, lack 
      of time or having health concerns because of a too high training intensity. 
      Therefore, we developed an exergaming based system to enhance long-term 
      motivation in the context of rehabilitation training. We combined different 
      hardware components such as vital sensors, a virtual reality headset, a motion 
      detecting camera, a bicycle ergometer and a motion platform to create an 
      immersive and fun experience for the training user without having to worry about 
      any negative health impact. Our evaluation shows that the system is well accepted 
      by the users and is capable of tackling the aforementioned reasons for an 
      inactive lifestyle. The system is designed to be easily extensible, safe to use 
      and enables professionals to adjust and to telemonitor the training at any time.

TI  - Kinect system in home-based cardiovascular rehabilitation.
PG  - 40-47
LID - 10.1177/0954411916679201 [doi]
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases lead to a high consumption of financial resources. An 
      important part of the recovery process is the cardiovascular rehabilitation. This 
      study aimed to present a new cardiovascular rehabilitation system to 11 
      outpatients with coronary artery disease from a Hospital in Porto, Portugal, 
      later collecting their opinions. This system is based on a virtual reality game 
      system, using the Kinect sensor while performing an exercise protocol which is 
      integrated in a home-based cardiovascular rehabilitation programme, with a 
      duration of 6 months and at the maintenance phase. The participants responded to 
      a questionnaire asking for their opinion about the system. The results 
      demonstrated that 91% of the participants (n = 10) enjoyed the artwork, while 
      100% (n = 11) agreed on the importance and usefulness of the automatic counting 
      of the number of repetitions, moreover 64% (n = 7) reported motivation to 
      continue performing the programme after the end of the study, and 100% (n = 11) 
      recognized Kinect as an instrument with potential to be an asset in 
      cardiovascular rehabilitation. Criticisms included limitations in motion capture 
      and gesture recognition, 91% (n = 10), and the lack of home space, 27% (n = 3). 
      According to the participants' opinions, the Kinect has the potential to be used 
      in cardiovascular rehabilitation; however, several technical details require 
      improvement, particularly regarding the motion capture and gesture recognition.

AB  - Recent progress in cardiac catheterization and devices has allowed the 
      development of new therapies for severe cardiac diseases like arrhythmias and 
      heart failure. The skills required for such interventions are very challenging to 
      learn, and are typically acquired over several years. Virtual reality simulators 
      may reduce this burden by allowing trainees to practice such procedures without 
      risk to patients. In this paper, we propose the first training system dedicated 
      to cardiac electrophysiology, including pacing and ablation procedures. Our 
      framework involves the simulation of a catheter navigation that reproduces issues 
      intrinsic to intra-cardiac catheterization, and a graphics processing unit 
      (GPU)-based electrophysiological model. A multithreading approach is proposed to 
      compute both physical simulations (navigation and electrophysiology) 
      asynchronously. With this method, we reach computational performances that 
      account for user interactions in real-time. Based on a scenario of cardiac 
      arrhythmia, we demonstrate the ability of the user-guided simulator to navigate 
      inside vessels and cardiac cavities with a catheter and to reproduce an ablation 
      procedure involving: extra-cellular potential measurements, endocardial surface 
      reconstruction, electrophysiology mapping, radio-frequency (RF) ablation, as well 
      as electrical stimulation. A clinical evaluation assessing the different aspects 
      of the simulation is presented. This works is a step towards computerized medical 
      learning curriculum.

TI  - Impact of acute stress on psychomotor bimanual performance during a simulated 
      tumor resection task.
PG  - 71-80
LID - 10.3171/2015.5.JNS15558 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE Severe bleeding during neurosurgical operations can result in acute 
      stress affecting the bimanual psychomotor performance of the operator, leading to 
      surgical error and an adverse patient outcome. Objective methods to assess the 
      influence of acute stress on neurosurgical bimanual psychomotor performance have 
      not been developed. Virtual reality simulators, such as NeuroTouch, allow the 
      testing of acute stress on psychomotor performance in risk-free environments. 
      Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the impact of a simulated 
      stressful virtual reality tumor resection scenario by utilizing NeuroTouch to 
      answer 2 questions: 1) What is the impact of acute stress on bimanual psychomotor 
      performance during the resection of simulated tumors? 2) Does acute stress 
      influence bimanual psychomotor performance immediately following the stressful 
      episode? METHODS Study participants included 6 neurosurgeons, 6 senior and 6 
      junior neurosurgical residents, and 6 medical students. Participants resected a 
      total of 6 simulated tumors, 1 of which (Tumor 4) involved uncontrollable 
      "intraoperative" bleeding resulting in simulated cardiac arrest and thus 
      providing the acute stress scenario. Tier 1 metrics included extent of blood 
      loss, percentage of tumor resected, and "normal" brain tissue volume removed. 
      Tier 2 metrics included simulated suction device (sucker) and ultrasonic 
      aspirator total tip path length, as well as the sum and maximum forces applied in 
      using these instruments. Advanced Tier 2 metrics included efficiency index, 
      coordination index, ultrasonic aspirator path length index, and ultrasonic 
      aspirator bimanual forces ratio. All metrics were assessed before, during, and 
      after the stressful scenario. RESULTS The stress scenario caused expected 
      significant increases in blood loss in all participant groups. Extent of tumor 
      resected and brain volume removed decreased in the junior resident and medical 
      student groups. Sucker total tip path length increased in the neurosurgeon group, 
      whereas sucker forces increased in the senior resident group. Psychomotor 
      performance on advanced Tier 2 metrics was altered during the stress scenario in 
      all participant groups. Performance on all advanced Tier 2 metrics returned to 
      pre-stress levels in the post-stress scenario tumor resections. CONCLUSIONS 
      Results demonstrated that acute stress initiated by simulated severe 
      intraoperative bleeding significantly decreases bimanual psychomotor performance 
      during the acute stressful episode. The simulated intraoperative bleeding event 
      had no significant influence on the advanced Tier 2 metrics monitored during the 
      immediate post-stress operative performance.

AB  - The 3D reconstruction of coronary artery from X-ray angiograms rotationally 
      acquired on C-arm has great clinical value. While cardiac-gated reconstruction 
      has shown promising results, it suffers from the problem of residual motion. This 
      work proposed a new local motion-compensated reconstruction method to handle this 
      issue. An initial image was firstly reconstructed using a regularized iterative 
      reconstruction method. Then a 3D/2D registration method was proposed to estimate 
      the residual vessel motion. Finally, the residual motion was compensated in the 
      final reconstruction using the extended iterative reconstruction method. Through 
      quantitative evaluation, it was found that high-quality 3D reconstruction could 
      be obtained and the result was comparable to state-of-the-art method.

AB  - Heart rate variability is a physiological measure associated with autonomic 
      nervous system activity. This study hypothesized that lower pre-deployment HRV 
      would be associated with higher post-deployment post-traumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD) symptoms. Three-hundred-forty-three Army National Guard soldiers enrolled 
      in the Warriors Achieving Resilience (WAR) study were analyzed. The primary 
      outcome was PTSD symptom severity using the PTSD Checklist - Military version 
      (PCL) measured at baseline, 3- and 12-month post-deployment. Heart rate 
      variability predictor variables included: high frequency power (HF) and standard 
      deviation of the normal cardiac inter-beat interval (SDNN). Generalized linear 
      mixed models revealed that the pre-deployment PCL*ln(HF) interaction term was 
      significant (p<0.0001). Pre-deployment SDNN was not a significant predictor of 
      post-deployment PCL. Covariates included age, pre-deployment PCL, race/ethnicity, 
      marital status, tobacco use, childhood abuse, pre-deployment traumatic brain 
      injury, and previous combat zone deployment. Pre-deployment heart rate 
      variability predicts post-deployment PTSD symptoms in the context of higher 
      pre-deployment PCL scores.

TI  - Does Virtual Reality-based Kinect Dance Training Paradigm Improve Autonomic 
      Nervous System Modulation in Individuals with Chronic Stroke?
PG  - 21-29
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity and low resting heart rate variability (HRV) are 
      associated with an increased cardiovascular deconditioning, risk of secondary 
      stroke and mortality. Aerobic dance is a multidimensional physical activity and 
      recent research supports its application as a valid alternative cardiovascular 
      training. Furthermore, technological advances have facilitated the emergence of 
      new approaches for exercise training holding promise, especially those methods 
      that integrate rehabilitation with virtual gaming. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this 
      study was to evaluate cardiac autonomic modulation in individuals with chronic 
      stroke post-training using a virtual reality - based aerobic dance training 
      paradigm. METHODS: Eleven community-dwelling individuals with hemiparetic stroke 
      [61.7( ± 4.3) years] received a virtual reality-based dance paradigm for 6 weeks 
      using the commercially available Kinect dance video game "Just Dance 3." The 
      training was delivered in a high-intensity tapering method with the first two 
      weeks consisting of 5 sessions/week, next two weeks of 3 sessions/week and last 
      two weeks of 2 sessions/week, with a total of 20 sessions. Data obtained for HRV 
      analysis pre- and post-intervention consists of HRV for ten minutes in (1) supine 
      resting position; (2) quiet standing. High-frequency (HF) power measures as 
      indicators of cardiac parasympathetic activity, low-frequency (LF) power of 
      parasympathetic-sympathetic balance and LF/HF of sympatho-vagal balance were 
      calculated. YMCA submaximal cycle Ergometer test was used to acquire VO(2) max 
      pre- and post-intervention. Changes in physical activity during dance training 
      were assessed using Omran HJ-321 Tri-Axis Pedometer. RESULTS: After training, 
      participants demonstrated a significant improvement in autonomic modulation in 
      the supine position, indicating an improvement in LF=48.4 ( ± 20.1) to 40.3 ( ± 
      8.0), p=0.03; HF=51.5 ( ± 19) to 59.7 ( ± 8), p= 0.02 and LF/HF=1.6 ( ± 1.9) to 
      0.8 ( ± 0.26), p=0.05]. Post-training the participants had significantly higher 
      VO(2max). Number of steps during dance intervention significantly increased from 
      the 1(st) to the 20(th) session (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The current study is the 
      first to assess the effect of a virtual reality-based aerobic dance training 
      paradigm on HRV among individuals with chronic stroke. Given that the paradigm 
      used in this study improves cardiac autonomic control, future studies should 
      incorporate dance as an adjuvant therapy into clinical treatment program and 
      assess its long-term efficacy.

TI  - Design of a cost-effective, hemodynamically adjustable model for resuscitative 
      endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) simulation.
PG  - 606-11
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000001153 [doi]
AB  - Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is an adjunct 
      technique for salvaging patients with noncompressible torso hemorrhage. Current 
      REBOA training paradigms require large animals, virtual reality simulators, or 
      human cadavers for acquisition of skills. These training strategies are expensive 
      and resource intensive, which may prevent widespread dissemination of REBOA. We 
      have developed a low-cost, near-physiologic, pulsatile REBOA simulator by 
      connecting an anatomic vascular circuit constructed out of latex and polyvinyl 
      chloride tubing to a commercially available pump. This pulsatile simulator is 
      capable of generating cardiac outputs ranging from 1.7 to 6.8 L/min with 
      corresponding arterial blood pressures of 54 to 226/14 to 121 mmHg. The simulator 
      accommodates a 12 French introducer sheath and a CODA balloon catheter. Upon 
      balloon inflation, the arterial waveform distal to the occlusion flattens, distal 
      pulsation within the simulator is lost, and systolic blood pressures proximal to 
      the balloon catheter increase by up to 62 mmHg. Further development and 
      validation of this simulator will allow for refinement, reduction, and 
      replacement of large animal models, costly virtual reality simulators, and 
      perfused cadavers for training purposes. This will ultimately facilitate the 
      low-cost, high-fidelity REBOA simulation needed for the widespread dissemination 
      of this life-saving technique.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease in which the 
      insulating cover of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged. The 
      methods used for motor rehabilitation of patients with neurological problems 
      require the performance of several rehabilitation exercises. Recently, studies 
      related to the use of video game consoles have proliferated in the field of motor 
      rehabilitation. Virtual reality (VR) has been proposed as a potentially useful 
      tool for motoring assessment and rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this 
      study was to investigate the results shown in previous studies on "Multiple 
      Sclerosis" and "Virtual Reality". METHOD: A bibliographic review was performed 
      without time limitations. The research was carried out using PubMed and BVS 
      databases. Considering keywords, we included articles that showed the terms 
      "Multiple Sclerosis" and "Virtual Reality". The review was according to the 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      guidelines RESULTS: The initial search yielded 41 articles. After the duplicates 
      were removed, two authors independently evaluated the title and abstract of each 
      of the articles with the study inclusion criteria. From these, 31 articles were 
      excluded based on the title and abstract. Finally, 10 articles were isolated that 
      met the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSION: VR represents a motivational and 
      effective alternative to traditional motor rehabilitation for MS patients. The 
      results showed that VR programs could be an effective method of patients with MS 
      rehabilitation in multiple cognitive and / or motor deficits. Additional research 
      is needed to support the rehabilitation protocols with VR and increase the 
      effects of treatment.

AB  - Several specific new technologies [high-resolution CT coronary imaging with 
      fractional flow reserve (CTCA-FFR), virtual reality (VR), vascular robotic 
      systems (VRS), and three-dimensional printing] are poised to improve the 
      treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and at the same time the safety 
      of the physicians who care for them. This article focuses on the potential 
      clinical impact each of these modalities will have, as well as speculating on 
      synergies that use of them together may achieve.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the currently available simulation training modalities used 
      to teach robotic surgery. METHODS: Forty surgical trainees completed a 
      standardized robotic 10-cm dissection of the internal thoracic artery and placed 
      3 sutures of a mitral valve annuloplasty in porcine models and were then 
      randomized to a wet lab, a dry lab, a virtual reality lab, or a control group 
      that received no additional training. All groups trained to a level of 
      proficiency determined by 2 expert robotic cardiac surgeons. All assessments were 
      evaluated using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills in a blinded 
      fashion. RESULTS: Wet lab trainees showed the greatest improvement in time-based 
      scoring and the objective scoring tool compared with the experts (mean, 
      24.9 ± 1.7 vs 24.9 ± 2.6; P = .704). The virtual reality lab improved their 
      scores and met the level of proficiency set by our experts for all primary 
      outcomes (mean, 24.9 ± 1.7 vs 22.8 ± 3.7; P = .103). Only the control group 
      trainees were not able to meet the expert level of proficiency for both 
      time-based scores and the objective scoring tool (mean, 24.9 ± 1.7 vs 11.0 ± 4.5; 
      P < .001). The average duration of training was shortest for the dry lab and 
      longest for the virtual reality simulation (1.6 hours vs 9.3 hours; P < .001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: We have completed the first randomized controlled trial to 
      objectively compare the different training modalities of robotic surgery. Our 
      data demonstrate the significant benefits of wet lab and virtual reality robotic 
      simulation training and highlight key differences in current training methods. 
      This study can help guide training programs in investing resources in 
      cost-effective, high-yield simulation exercises.

AB  - We report a case of successful computed tomography-guided percutaneous 
      revascularization of a chronically occluded right coronary artery using a 
      wearable, hands-free computer with a head-mounted display worn by interventional 
      cardiologists in the catheterization laboratory. The projection of 3-dimensional 
      computed tomographic reconstructions onto the screen of virtual reality glass 
      allowed the operators to clearly visualize the distal coronary vessel, and verify 
      the direction of the guide wire advancement relative to the course of the 
      occluded vessel segment. This case provides proof of concept that wearable 
      computers can improve operator comfort and procedure efficiency in interventional 
      cardiology.

AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to explore if proficiency-based training in a 
      coronary angiography (CA) simulator can transfer acquired skills from virtual 
      reality (VR) to the real world in order to improve early performance. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Sixteen senior cardiology residents were randomised to proficiency-based 
      VR training or control. Two consecutive CAs were performed on patients. Skills 
      metrics and errors were compared between the groups. Thirty-two CAs were 
      performed under the supervision of an experienced interventionalist. VR-trained 
      residents practised for a mean of 10 hours in a CA simulator. In real life, the 
      VR-trained group had shorter fluoroscopy and total procedure times than the 
      controls (median 558 vs. 842 seconds, p=0.003 and 1,356 vs. 1,623 seconds, 
      p=0.032, respectively). The controls had a higher error score (median 27 vs. 15, 
      p=0.002) and a lower performance score (median 47 vs. 68, p=0.006) than the 
      VR-trained residents. CONCLUSIONS: Simulator-based training in CA improved skills 
      and decreased errors compared to mentor-based training only. CA training in VR 
      resulted in a superior performance, measured by fluoroscopy and total procedure 
      times, and superior error and performance scores, thereby confirming transfer 
      validity. Our recommendation is to incorporate VR training in the curriculum for 
      the general cardiologist to improve safe learning in CA.

      vascular surgery technologies have benefited many patients with cardiovascular or 
      cerebrovascular diseases. Due to the absence of effective training measures, 
      these new advanced technologies have not been fully utilized and only few 
      experienced surgeons can perform such complicated surgeries so far. In order to 
      solve such problems, virtual reality based vascular interventional surgery 
      training system, a promising way to train young surgeons or assist experienced 
      surgeons to perform surgery, has been widely studied. METHODS: In this paper, we 
      mainly conduct a thorough study on both reliable deformation and high real-time 
      performance of an interactive surgery training system. An efficient hybrid 
      geometric blood vessel model which handles the collision detection query and 
      vascular deformation calculation separately is employed to enhance the real-time 
      performance of our surgery training system. In addition, a position-based dynamic 
      approach with volume conservation constraint is used to improve the vascular 
      deformation result. Finally, a hash table based spatial adaptive acceleration 
      algorithm which makes the training system much more efficient and reliable is 
      described. RESULTS: Several necessary experiments are conducted to validate the 
      vascular deformation scheme presented in this paper. From the results we can see 
      that the position-based dynamic modeling method with volume conservation 
      constraint can prevent the vascular deformation from the issue of penetration. In 
      addition, the deformation calculation with spatial acceleration algorithm has 
      enhanced the real-time performance significantly. CONCLUSION: The corresponding 
      experimental results indicate that both the hybrid geometric blood vessel model 
      and the hash table based spatial adaptive acceleration algorithm can enhance the 
      performance of our surgery training system greatly without losing the deformation 
      accuracy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of trainee's ability in obstetrical ultrasound is a 
      time-consuming process, which requires involving patients as volunteers. With the 
      use of obstetrical ultrasound simulators, virtual reality could help in assessing 
      competency and evaluating trainees in this field. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the 
      study was to test the validity of an obstetrical ultrasound simulator as a tool 
      for evaluating trainees following structured training by comparing scores 
      obtained on obstetrical ultrasound simulator with those obtained on volunteers 
      and by assessing correlations between scores of images and of dexterity given by 
      2 blinded examiners. STUDY DESIGN: Trainees, taking the 2013 French national 
      examination for the practice of obstetrical ultrasound were asked to obtain 
      standardized ultrasound planes both on volunteer pregnant women and on an 
      obstetrical ultrasound simulator. These planes included measurements of 
      biparietal diameter, abdominal circumference, and femur length as well as 
      reference planes for cardiac 4-chamber and outflow tracts, kidneys, 
      stomach/diaphragm, spine, and face. Images were stored and evaluated subsequently 
      by 2 national examiners who scored each picture according to previously 
      established quality criteria. Dexterity was also evaluated and subjectively 
      scored between 0 and 10. The Raghunathan's modification of Pearson, Filon's z, 
      Spearman's rank correlation, and analysis of variance tests were used to assess 
      correlations between the scores by the 2 examiners and scores of dexterity and 
      also to compare the final scores between the 2 different methods. RESULTS: We 
      evaluated 29 trainees. The mean dexterity scores in simulation (6.5 ± 2.0) and 
      real examination (5.9 ± 2.3) were comparable (P = .31). Scores with an 
      obstetrical ultrasound simulator were significantly higher than those obtained on 
      volunteers (P = .027). Nevertheless, there was a good correlation between the 
      scores of the 2 examiners judging on simulation (R = 0.888) and on volunteers (R 
      = 0.873) (P = .81). CONCLUSION: An obstetrical ultrasound simulator is as good a 
      method as volunteer-based examination for evaluating practical skills in trainees 
      following structured training in obstetrical ultrasound. The threshold for 
      success/failure should, however, be adapted as candidates obtain higher scores on 
      the simulator. Advantages of the obstetrical ultrasound simulator include the 
      absence of location and time constraints without the need to involve volunteers 
      or to interfere with the running of ultrasound clinics. However, an obstetrical 
      ultrasound simulator still lacks the ability to evaluate the trainees' ability to 
      interact with patients.

AB  - Computer-assisted 3D models are used in some medical and allied health science 
      schools; however, they are often limited to online use and 2D flat screen-based 
      imaging. Few schools take advantage of 3D stereoscopic learning tools in anatomy 
      education and clinically relevant anatomical variations when teaching anatomy. A 
      new approach to teaching anatomy includes use of computed tomography angiography 
      (CTA) images of the head and neck to create clinically relevant 3D stereoscopic 
      virtual models. These high resolution images of the arteries can be used in 
      unique and innovative ways to create 3D virtual models of the vasculature as a 
      tool for teaching anatomy. Blood vessel 3D models are presented stereoscopically 
      in a virtual reality environment, can be rotated 360° in all axes, and magnified 
      according to need. In addition, flexible views of internal structures are 
      possible. Images are displayed in a stereoscopic mode, and students view images 
      in a small theater-like classroom while wearing polarized 3D glasses. 
      Reconstructed 3D models enable students to visualize vascular structures with 
      clinically relevant anatomical variations in the head and neck and appreciate 
      spatial relationships among the blood vessels, the skull and the skin.

LID - 10.1136/bmjstel-2015-000090 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We assessed the transfer of training (ToT) of virtual reality 
      simulation training compared to invasive vascular experience training for carotid 
      artery angiography (CA) for highly experienced interventionists but new to 
      carotid procedures. METHODS: Prospective, randomised and blinded. SETTING: 
      Catheterisation and skills laboratories in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: Experienced 
      (mean volume=15 000 cases) interventional cardiologists (n=12) were randomised to 
      train on virtual reality (VR) simulation to a quantitatively defined level of 
      proficiency or to a traditional supervised in vivo patient case training. OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: The observed performance differences in performing a CA between two 
      matched groups were then blindly assessed using predefined metrics of 
      performance. RESULTS: Experienced interventional cardiologists trained on the VR 
      simulator performed significantly better than their equally experienced controls 
      showing a significantly lower rate of objectively assessed intraoperative errors 
      in CA. Performance showed 17-49% ToT from the VR to the in vivo index case. 
      DISCUSSION: This is the first prospective, randomised and blinded clinical study 
      to report that VR simulation training transfers improved procedural skills to 
      clinical performance on live patients for experienced interventionists. This 
      study, for the first time, demonstrates that VR simulation offers a powerful, 
      safe and effective platform for training interventional skills for highly 
      experienced interventionists with the greatest impact on procedural error 
      reduction.

TI  - Using Virtual Reality to Distract Overweight Children from Bodily Sensations 
      During Exercise.
PG  - 115-9
LID - 10.1089/cyber.2015.0283 [doi]
AB  - This study analyzes the potential of virtual reality (VR) to enhance attentional 
      distraction in overweight children as they experience bodily sensations during 
      exercise. It has been suggested that one reason why obese children stop 
      exercising is the perception of bodily sensations. In a counterbalanced design, a 
      total of 109 children (33 overweight, 10-15 years old) were asked to walk twice 
      for 6 minutes on a treadmill under one of two conditions: (a) traditional 
      condition (TC)-focusing their attention on their physical feelings and sensations 
      or (b) distraction condition (DC)-focusing their attention on a virtual 
      environment. Attentional focus during exercise, bad-good feeling states (pre- and 
      postexperimental), perceived exertion (3 minutes and post), heart rate, and 
      enjoyment were assessed. Results indicated that overweight children focused on 
      internal information under the TC, but they significantly shifted their attention 
      to regard the external environment in the DC. This attentional distraction effect 
      of VR was more intense in overweight than in normal-weight children. No 
      differences between groups were found when examining changes in feeling states 
      and perceived exertion. VR increased enjoyment during exercise, and children 
      preferred exercise using virtual environments. VR is useful to promote 
      distraction and may help overweight and obese children to enjoy exercise.

TI  - Does Simulation-Based Training Improve Procedural Skills of Beginners in 
      Interventional Cardiology?--A Stratified Randomized Study.
PG  - 75-82
LID - 10.1111/joic.12257 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether mentored simulation-based-training can improve the 
      procedural skills of beginners in coronary interventional procedures. BACKGROUND: 
      Simulation based-catheter training is a valuable tool to practice interventional 
      procedures. Whether this type of training enhances the procedural skills of 
      fellows learning percutaneous coronary interventions has never been studied. 
      METHODS: Eighteen cardiology fellows were randomized either into the 
      simulation-based training (n = 9) or the control group (n = 9). The simulation 
      group received 7.5 hours of virtual reality (VR) simulation training, whereas the 
      control group attended 4.5 hours of lectures. Each participant had to perform a 
      simple (pre-evaluation) and a more complex (post-evaluation) catheter 
      intervention on a pulsatile coronary flow model in a catheterization laboratory. 
      All procedures were videotaped, analyzed, and rated by 3 expert 
      interventionalists, who were blinded to the randomization. To assess the 
      individual performance level, a "skills score" was determined, comprising 14 
      performance characteristics (5-level Likert scale, maximum score of 70 points). 
      RESULTS: The "skills score" increased by 5.8 ± 6.1 points in the VR simulation 
      group and decreased by 6.7 ± 8.4 in the control group (P = 0.003) from the simple 
      stenosis at pre- to the more complex lesion at post-evaluation demonstrating the 
      effectiveness of simulation-based training. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests 
      that curriculum-based mentored VR simulation training improves the performance 
      level of cardiology fellows in coronary interventions. Further investigation to 
      evaluate the effect on clinical outcomes is warranted.

TI  - A virtual reality intervention (Second Life) to improve weight maintenance: 
      Rationale and design for an 18-month randomized trial.

AB  - Despite the plethora of weight loss programs available in the US, the prevalence 
      of overweight and obesity (BMI≥25kg/m(2)) among US adults continues to rise at 
      least, in part, due to the high probability of weight regain following weight 
      loss. Thus, the development and evaluation of novel interventions designed to 
      improve weight maintenance are clearly needed. Virtual reality environments offer 
      a promising platform for delivering weight maintenance interventions as they 
      provide rapid feedback, learner experimentation, real-time personalized task 
      selection and exploration. Utilizing virtual reality during weight maintenance 
      allows individuals to engage in repeated experiential learning, practice skills, 
      and participate in real-life scenarios without real-life repercussions, which may 
      diminish weight regain. We will conduct an 18-month effectiveness trial (6 months 
      weight loss, 12 months weight maintenance) in 202 overweight/obese adults (BMI 
      25-44.9kg/m(2)). Participants who achieve ≥5% weight loss following a 6month 
      weight loss intervention delivered by phone conference call will be randomized to 
      weight maintenance interventions delivered by conference call or conducted in a 
      virtual environment (Second Life®). The primary aim of the study is to compare 
      weight change during maintenance between the phone conference call and virtual 
      groups. Secondarily, potential mediators of weight change including energy and 
      macronutrient intake, physical activity, consumption of fruits and vegetables, 
      self-efficacy for both physical activity and diet, and attendance and completion 
      of experiential learning assignments will also be assessed.

TI  - An innovative cycling exergame to promote cardiovascular fitness in youth with 
      cerebral palsy.
PG  - 135-40
LID - 10.3109/17518423.2014.923056 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an internet-platform exergame cycling 
      programme on cardiovascular fitness of youth with cerebral palsy (CP). METHODS: 
      In this pilot prospective case series, eight youth with bilateral spastic CP, 
      Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) level III, completed a 
      six-week exergame programme. Outcomes were obtained at baseline and 
      post-intervention. The primary outcome measure was the GMFCS III-specific shuttle 
      run test (SRT-III). Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life 
      (HQL) as measured by the KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaire, six-minute walk test, 
      Wingate arm cranking test and anthropomorphic measurements. RESULTS: There were 
      significant improvements in the SRT-III (t = -2.5, p = 0.04, d = 0.88) 
      post-intervention. There were no significant changes in secondary outcomes. 
      CONCLUSION: An exergame cycling programme may lead to improvement in 
      cardiovascular fitness in youth with CP. This study was limited by small sample 
      size and lack of a comparison group. Future research is warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fundamental skills testing is now required for certification in 
      general surgery. No model for assessing fundamental endovascular skills exists. 
      Our objective was to develop a model that tests the fundamental endovascular 
      skills and differentiates competent from noncompetent performance. METHODS: The 
      Fundamentals of Endovascular Surgery model was developed in silicon and 
      virtual-reality versions. Twenty individuals (with a range of experience) 
      performed four tasks on each model in three separate sessions. Tasks on the 
      silicon model were performed under fluoroscopic guidance, and electromagnetic 
      tracking captured motion metrics for catheter tip position. Image processing 
      captured tool tip position and motion on the virtual model. Performance was 
      evaluated using a global rating scale, blinded video assessment of error metrics, 
      and catheter tip movement and position. Motion analysis was based on derivations 
      of speed and position that define proficiency of movement (spectral arc length, 
      duration of submovement, and number of submovements). RESULTS: Performance was 
      significantly different between competent and noncompetent interventionalists for 
      the three performance measures of motion metrics, error metrics, and global 
      rating scale. The mean error metric score was 6.83 for noncompetent individuals 
      and 2.51 for the competent group (P < .0001). Median global rating scores were 
      2.25 for the noncompetent group and 4.75 for the competent users (P < .0001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The Fundamentals of Endovascular Surgery model successfully 
      differentiates competent and noncompetent performance of fundamental endovascular 
      skills based on a series of objective performance measures. This model could 
      serve as a platform for skills testing for all trainees.

TI  - Validation of a Novel Virtual Reality Training Curriculum for Robotic Cardiac 
      Surgery: A Randomized Trial.
PG  - 383-8

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Robotic cardiac surgery training has relied entirely on classical 
      methods of surgical teaching. We sought to evaluate the impact of a virtual 
      reality (VR) simulation curriculum to improve skill acquisition in robotic 
      cardiac surgery. METHODS: We randomly assigned 20 surgical trainees to undergo a 
      9-exercise VR curriculum on a robotic surgical simulator or a control group that 
      received no additional training. The trainees were then evaluated in a blinded 
      fashion by assessing their de-identified video recordings of the following: (1) 
      standardized robotic internal thoracic artery harvest and (2) mitral valve 
      annuloplasty performed in porcine models, using a validated time-based scoring 
      system and an objective intraoperative scoring tool. Postintervention assessments 
      were compared to baseline. RESULTS: Trainees randomized to the VR group were 
      faster than the control group for both the internal thoracic artery harvest 
      (957.3 ± 98.9 vs. 749.1 ± 171.9; P = 0.004) and mitral annuloplasty (580.4 ± 14.4 
      vs. 463.8 ± 86.4; P < 0.001) and scored significantly higher with the 
      intraoperative scoring tool (22.8 ± 2.7 vs. 11.0 ± 4.5; P < 0.001). Additionally, 
      the VR group achieved a proficiency level similar to our experts for both 
      time-based scores (P = 0.624 and P = 0.967), and the intraoperative assessment (P 
      = 0.110), whereas the control group was not able to meet this level of 
      proficiency for any of the primary outcomes. The average duration of training to 
      successfully complete all required tasks was 9.3 hours. CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      demonstrated that a VR simulation curriculum can significantly improve the 
      efficiency and quality of learning in robotic cardiac surgery. Further evaluation 
      of this curriculum is required for its widespread implementation in surgical 
      training (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT#02357056).

AB  - Prior findings indicate that individuals scoring high on vital exhaustion show a 
      dysfunctional stress response (DSR), that is, reduced cortisol reactivity and 
      habituation to psychosocial stressors. The main aim of the present study was to 
      examine whether a DSR may be a vulnerability factor in exhaustion disorder (ED). 
      We examined whether a DSR is present during the early stages of ED, and still is 
      present after recovery. Three groups were studied: 1. Former ED patients (n=14); 
      2. persons who during the past 6 month had experienced stress at work and had a 
      Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ) score over 3.75, considered to 
      indicate a pre-stage of ED (n=17); 3. persons who had not experienced stress at 
      work during the past 6 months and had a SMBQ score below 2.75 (n=20). The 
      participants were exposed twice to a virtual version of the Trier Social Stress 
      Test (V-TSST), during which salivary cortisol samples were collected. In 
      addition, high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), heart rate (HR), t-wave 
      amplitude (TWA), and α-amylase were assessed to examine stress reactivity and 
      habituation in the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The initial analyses showed 
      clear hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system 
      (SNS) activations in both V-TSST sessions, together with habituation of cortisol 
      and heart rate in the second session, but without any significant group 
      differences. However, the former ED patients showed considerable variation in 
      self-reported signs of exhaustion (SMBQ). This led us to assign former ED 
      patients with lower ratings into the low SMBQ group (LOWS) and those with higher 
      ratings to the high SMBQ group (HIGHS). When repeating the analyses a different 
      picture emerged; the HIGHS showed a lower cortisol response to the V-TSST than 
      did the LOWS. Both groups' cortisol response habituated to the second V-TSST 
      session. The ANS responses did not differ between the two groups. Thus, persons 
      in a pre-stage of ED and unrecovered former ED patients showed signs of DSR, in 
      contrast to healthy controls and recovered former ED patients. The results may be 
      interpreted as indicating that DSR in the HPA axis is present early on in the 
      stress process, but subsides after successful recovery.

TI  - The application of walking training in the rehabilitation of patients after 
      coronary artery bypass grafting.
PG  - 275-87
LID - 10.5114/kitp.2015.54471 [doi]
AB  - Walking is regarded as one of the most common and utilitarian activities of 
      everyday life. Rehabilitation programs developed on the basis of this form of 
      activity often constitute the primary method of rehabilitating patients after 
      coronary artery bypass grafting. This paper provides a review of literature 
      concerning various forms of walking training, discussing their impact on the 
      parameters of exercise capacity and verifying the training methods with regard to 
      the current guidelines. Attention is drawn to the diversity of the exercise 
      protocols applied during the early and late stages of rehabilitation and 
      pre-rehabilitation programs including: treadmill walking, walking down the 
      corridor, treadmill walking enriched with virtual reality, and walking as an 
      element of training sessions consisting of many different forms of activities. 
      Exercise protocols were also analyzed in terms of their safety, especially in the 
      case of high-intensity interval training. Despite the variety of the available 
      rehabilitation programs, the training methodology requires constant improvement, 
      particularly in terms of load dosage and the supervision of training sessions.

PG  - 2863-5
LID - 10.1589/jpts.27.2863 [doi]
AB  - [Purpose] This study evaluated the acute cardiovascular responses during a 
      session of Zumba(®) Fitness in a virtual reality environment. [Subjects] Eighteen 
      healthy volunteers were recruited. [Methods] The following cardiovascular 
      variables: heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and 
      double product were assessed before and after the practice of virtual Zumba(®), 
      which was performed as a continuous sequence of five choreographed movements 
      lasting for 22 min. The game Zumba Fitness Core(®), with the Kinect-based virtual 
      reality system for the XBOX 360, was used to create the virtual environment. 
      Comparisons were made among mean delta values (delta=post-Zumba(®) minus 
      pre-Zumba(®) values) for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and 
      double product using Student's t-test for paired samples. [Results] After a 
      single session, a significant increase was noted in all the analyzed parameters 
      (Systolic blood pressure=18%; Diastolic blood pressure=13%; Heart rate=67%; and 
      Double product=97%). [Conclusion] The results support the feasibility of the use 
      of Zumba Fitness Core(®) with the Kinect-based virtual reality system for the 
      XBOX 360 in physical activity programs and further favor its indication for this 
      purpose.

TI  - [THE ROLE OF SIMULATION IN SURGICAL TRAINING--A NEW ERA].
PG  - 398-403
AB  - Surgical training, which was traditionally based on the apprentice model, is 
      undergoing a fundamental change since the introduction of virtual reality 
      simulators into the training program of surgical residents. With the introduction 
      of these simulators we can expect to see an improvement in the surgical abilities 
      of new surgeons and a decrease in costs--as seen in the aviation world. Virtual 
      reality simulators include a visual and tactile interface which is meant to train 
      young surgeons in full procedure before the actual surgery. The available 
      operation encompasses a multitude of surgical disciplines--gynecology, urology, 
      orthopedics, vascular surgery, general surgery and more. The simulator allows the 
      surgeon to practice complicated procedures and to be exposed to emergency 
      situations without risking the patient's life. We opened in the Carmel Medical 
      Center a multi disciplinary simulation center 18 months ago. The center includes 
      simulators for gynecology, orthopedics, urology, general surgery, vascular 
      surgery and advanced cardiac life support. The center cooperates with the Faculty 
      of Medicine at the Technion in order to train young surgeons in all surgical 
      disciplines. In this period of time we followed the improvement in the endoscopic 
      abilities of the basic skills course participants.

TI  - A study protocol of a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of a 
      symptom self-management programme for people with acute myocardial infarction.
PG  - 1299-309
LID - 10.1111/jan.12594 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To report a study protocol of a randomized controlled trial examining if a 
      symptom self-management programme helps patients with acute myocardial infarction 
      self-manage their physical and psychological symptoms. BACKGROUND: In addition to 
      physical conditions, people with acute myocardial infarction often experience 
      psychological symptoms. However, there is limited empirical evidence on how to 
      help individuals self-manage these psychological symptoms. DESIGN: A 
      single-blinded, randomized controlled trial is proposed. METHODS: A convenience 
      sample of 90 will be recruited. Eligible participants will be adult patients with 
      acute myocardial infarction hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. 
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups: 
      Intervention 1 and standard care (n = 30), Intervention 2 and standard care 
      (n = 30) and standard care alone (n = 30). Data will be collected by 
      self-reported questionnaires, physiological measures and open-ended questions. 
      Quantitative data will be analysed by descriptive statistics, t-test, analysis of 
      covariance and repeated measures analysis of variance. Open-ended questions will 
      be analysed by content analysis. DISCUSSION: This study will identify a 
      potentially efficacious symptom self-management programme for patients with acute 
      myocardial infarction. If the efficacy of the programme is demonstrated, the 
      programme can be integrated into hospital services to improve patient care. A new 
      teaching method (virtual reality-based teaching) and new teaching materials 
      (virtual reality videos and relaxation videos) derived from this study can be 
      offered to patients. Future research with larger samples and multi-centre 
      recruitment can be undertaken to further test the efficacy of the interventions.

      current perspectives.
PG  - 195-202
LID - 10.2147/VHRM.S46194 [doi]
AB  - Endovascular technologies are rapidly evolving, often requiring coordination and 
      cooperation between clinicians and technicians from diverse specialties. These 
      multidisciplinary interactions lead to challenges that are reflected in the high 
      rate of errors occurring during endovascular procedures. Endovascular virtual 
      reality (VR) simulation has evolved from simple benchtop devices to full physic 
      simulators with advanced haptics and dynamic imaging and physiological controls. 
      The latest developments in this field include the use of fully immersive 
      simulated hybrid angiosuites to train whole endovascular teams in crisis resource 
      management and novel technologies that enable practitioners to build VR 
      simulations based on patient-specific anatomy. As our understanding of the 
      skills, both technical and nontechnical, required for optimal endovascular 
      performance improves, the requisite tools for objective assessment of these 
      skills are being developed and will further enable the use of VR simulation in 
      the training and assessment of endovascular interventionalists and their entire 
      teams. Simulation training that allows deliberate practice without danger to 
      patients may be key to bridging the gap between new endovascular technology and 
      improved patient outcomes.

TI  - Virtual reality lead extraction as a method for training new physicians: a pilot 
      study.
PG  - 319-25
LID - 10.1111/pace.12546 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is estimated that the demand for transvenous lead extraction (TLE) 
      has reached an annual extraction rate of nearly 24,000 patients worldwide. 
      Despite technologic advances, TLE still has the potential for significant 
      morbidity and mortality. Complication rates with TLE directly parallel operator 
      experience. However, obtaining adequate training during and postfellowship can be 
      difficult. Given the potential for catastrophic complications and the steep 
      learning curve (up to 300 cases) associated with this procedure, we sought to 
      validate a virtual reality (VR) lead extraction simulator as an innovative 
      training and evaluation tool for physicians new to TLE. METHODS: We randomized 
      eight electrophysiology fellows to VR simulator versus conventional training. We 
      compared procedural skill competency between the groups using simulator 
      competency, tactile measurements, markers of proficiency and attitudes, and 
      cognitive abilities battery. RESULTS: Practical skills and simulator 
      complications differed significantly between the VR simulator and conventional 
      training groups. The VR simulator group executed patient preparation and 
      procedure performance better than the conventional group (P < 0.01). All four 
      fellows randomized to conventional training experienced a simulator complication 
      (two superior vena cava [SVC] tears, three right ventricle [RV] avulsions) versus 
      one fellow in the VR simulator group (one SVC tear) (P = 0.02). Tactile 
      measurements revealed a trend toward excess pushing versus pulling forces among 
      the conventionally trained group. The time for lead removal was also 
      significantly higher in the conventional training group (12.46 minutes vs 5.54 
      minutes, P = 0.02). There was no significant difference in baseline or 
      posttraining cognitive ability. CONCLUSIONS: We contend that the implementation 
      of alternative training tools such as a VR simulation model will improve 
      physician training and allow for an innovative pathway to assess the achievement 
      of competency.

TI  - Influential factors for pressure pulse waveform in healthy young adults.
PG  - S497-505
LID - 10.3233/BME-151339 [doi]
AB  - The effects of gender and other contributory factors on pulse waveform are still 
      under arguments. In view of different results caused by few considerations of 
      possible influential factors and general agreement of gender relating to pulse 
      waveform, this study aims to address the confounding factors interfering with the 
      association between gender and pulse waveform characteristics. A novel method was 
      proposed to noninvasively detect pressure pulse wave and assess the morphology of 
      pulse wave. Forty healthy young subjects were included in the present research. 
      Height, weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
      were measured manually and body mass index (BMI), pulse blood pressure (PP) and 
      heart rate (HR) were calculated automatically. Student's t test was used to 
      analyze the gender difference and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to examine the 
      effects of intrinsic factors. Univariate regression analysis was performed to 
      assess the main factors on the waveform characteristics. Waveform features were 
      found significantly different between genders. However this study indicates that 
      the main factors for time-related and amplitude-related parameters are HR and SBP 
      respectively. In conclusion, the impact of HR and SBP on pulse waveform features 
      should not be underestimated, especially when analyzing the gender difference.

TI  - Virtual-Reality Simulator System for Double Interventional Cardiac 
      Catheterization Using Fractional-Order Vascular Access Tracker and Haptic Force 
      Producer.
PG  - 697569

AB  - This study proposes virtual-reality (VR) simulator system for double 
      interventional cardiac catheterization (ICC) using fractional-order vascular 
      access tracker and haptic force producer. An endoscope or a catheter for 
      diagnosis and surgery of cardiovascular disease has been commonly used in 
      minimally invasive surgery. It needs specific skills and experiences for young 
      surgeons or postgraduate year (PGY) students to operate a Berman catheter and a 
      pigtail catheter in the inside of the human body and requires avoiding damaging 
      vessels. To improve the training in inserting catheters, a double-catheter 
      mechanism is designed for the ICC procedures. A fractional-order vascular access 
      tracker is used to trace the senior surgeons' consoled trajectories and transmit 
      the frictional feedback and visual feedback during the insertion of catheters. 
      Based on the clinical feeling through the aortic arch, vein into the ventricle, 
      or tortuous blood vessels, haptic force producer is used to mock the elasticity 
      of the vessel wall using voice coil motors (VCMs). The VR establishment with 
      surgeons' consoled vessel trajectories and hand feeling is achieved, and the 
      experimental results show the effectiveness for the double ICC procedures.

      surgical procedures. AYRA was developed under a research, development and 
      innovation project financed by the Andalusian Ministry of Health, called VirSSPA. 
      Nowadays AYRA has been successfully used in more than 1160 real cases and after 
      proving its efficiency it has been introduced in the clinical practice at the 
      Virgen del Rocío University Hospital . Furthermore, AYRA allows generating 
      physical 3D biomodels using rapid prototyping technology. They are used for 
      surgical planning support, intraoperative reference or defect reconstruction. In 
      this paper, some of these tools and some real cases are presented.

AB  - A virtual reality (VR) based vascular intervention simulation system is 
      introduced in this paper, which helps trainees develop surgical skills and 
      experience complications in safety remote from patients. The system simulates 
      interventional radiology procedures, in which flexible tipped guidewires are 
      employed to advance diagnostic or therapeutic catheters into vascular anatomy of 
      a patient. A real-time physically-based modeling approach ground on Kirchhoff 
      elastic rod is proposed to simulate complicated behaviors of guidewires and 
      catheters. The slender body of guidewire and catheter is modeled using more 
      efficient special case of naturally straight, isotropic Kirchhoff rods, and the 
      shorter flexible tip composed of straight or angled design is modeled using more 
      complex generalized Kirchhoff rods. The motion equations for guidewire and 
      catheter were derived with continuous elastic energy, followed by a 
      discretization using a linear implicit scheme that guarantees stability and 
      robustness. In addition, we used a fast-projection method to enforce the 
      inextensibility of guidewire and catheter. An adaptive sampling algorithm was 
      also implemented to improve the simulation efficiency without decrease of 
      accuracy. Experimental results revealed that our system is both robust and 
      efficient in a real-time performance.

TI  - Using virtual reality to explore self-regulation in high-risk settings.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) models allow investigators to explore high-risk situations 
      carefully in the laboratory using physiological assessment strategies and 
      controlled conditions not available in field settings. This article introduces 
      the use of a virtual experience to examine the influence of self-regulatory 
      skills training on female participants' reactions to a high-risk encounter with 
      an aggressive male. Sixty-three female participants were recruited for the study. 
      Demographic data indicated that 54% of the participants were not currently in a 
      relationship, 36.5% were in a committed relationship, and 9.5% were occasionally 
      dating. After obtaining informed consent, participants were assigned randomly to 
      either a diaphragmatic breathing training condition or an attention control 
      condition. Results indicated that both groups rated the virtual environment as 
      equally realistic; the aggressive advances of the male were also perceived as 
      equally real across the two experimental groups. Physiological data indicated 
      that there were no differences between the groups on respiration or 
      cardiovascular measures during baseline or during the VR task. After the VR 
      experience, however, the participants in the breathing training condition had 
      lower respiration rates and higher heart rate variability measures than those in 
      the control condition. The results suggest that VR platforms provide a realistic 
      and challenging environment to examine how self-regulation procedures may 
      influence behavioral outcomes. Real-time dynamic engagement in a virtual setting 
      affords investigators with an opportunity to evaluate the utility of 
      self-regulatory skills training for improving safety in situations where there 
      are uncertain and risky outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) is a series of team-based, 
      sequential and time constrained interventions, requiring effective communication 
      and coordination of activities that are performed by the care provider team on a 
      patient undergoing cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. The state-of-the-art 
      ACLS training is conducted in a face-to-face environment under expert supervision 
      and suffers from several drawbacks including conflicting care provider schedules 
      and high cost of training equipment. OBJECTIVE: The major objective of the study 
      is to describe, including the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel 
      approach of delivering ACLS training to care providers using the proposed virtual 
      reality simulator that can overcome the challenges and drawbacks imposed by the 
      traditional face-to-face training method. METHODS: We compare the efficacy and 
      performance outcomes associated with traditional ACLS training with the proposed 
      novel approach of using a virtual reality (VR) based ACLS training simulator. One 
      hundred and forty-eight (148) ACLS certified clinicians, translating into 26 care 
      provider teams, were enrolled for this study. Each team was randomly assigned to 
      one of the three treatment groups: control (traditional ACLS training), 
      persuasive (VR ACLS training with comprehensive feedback components), or 
      minimally persuasive (VR ACLS training with limited feedback components). The 
      teams were tested across two different ACLS procedures that vary in the degree of 
      task complexity: ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia (VFib/VTach) and 
      pulseless electric activity (PEA). RESULTS: The difference in performance between 
      control and persuasive groups was not statistically significant (P=.37 for PEA 
      and P=.1 for VFib/VTach). However, the difference in performance between control 
      and minimally persuasive groups was significant (P=.05 for PEA and P=.02 for 
      VFib/VTach). The pre-post comparison of performances of the groups showed that 
      control (P=.017 for PEA, P=.01 for VFib/VTach) and persuasive (P=.02 for PEA, 
      P=.048 for VFib/VTach) groups improved their performances significantly, whereas 
      minimally persuasive group did not (P=.45 for PEA, P=.46 for VFib/VTach). Results 
      also suggest that the benefit of persuasiveness is constrained by the potentially 
      interruptive nature of these features. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the 
      VR-based ACLS training with proper feedback components can provide a learning 
      experience similar to face-to-face training, and therefore could serve as a more 
      easily accessed supplementary training tool to the traditional ACLS training. Our 
      findings also suggest that the degree of persuasive features in VR environments 
      have to be designed considering the interruptive nature of the feedback elements.

TI  - A study of the effect of dyad practice versus that of individual practice on 
      simulation-based complex skills learning and of students' perceptions of how and 
      why dyad practice contributes to learning.
PG  - 1287-94
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000000373 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aims of this study were (1) to explore the effectiveness of dyad 
      practice compared with individual practice on a simulator for learning a complex 
      clinical skill and (2) to explore medical students' perceptions of how and why 
      dyad practice on a simulator contributes to learning a complex skill. METHOD: In 
      2011, the authors randomly assigned 84 medical students to either the dyad or the 
      individual practice group to learn coronary angiography skills using instruction 
      videos and a simulator. Two weeks later, participants each performed two 
      video-recorded coronary angiographies on the simulator. Two raters used a rating 
      scale to assess the participants' video-recorded performance. The authors then 
      interviewed the participants in the dyad practice group. RESULTS: Seventy-two 
      (86%) participants completed the study. The authors found no significant 
      difference between the performance scores of the two groups (mean±standard 
      deviation, 68%±13% for individual versus 63%±16% for dyad practice; P=.18). Dyad 
      practice participants noted that several key factors contributed to their 
      learning: being equal-level novices, the quality of the cooperation between 
      partners, observational learning and overt communication, social aspects and 
      motivation, and meta-cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Dyad practice is more efficient and 
      thus more cost-effective than individual practice and can be used for costly 
      virtual reality simulator training. However, dyad practice may not apply to 
      clinical training involving real patients because learning from errors and overt 
      communication, both keys to dyad practice, do not transfer to clinical practice.

AB  - The use of virtual reality (VR) training tools for medical education could lead 
      to improvements in the skills of clinicians while providing economic incentives 
      for healthcare institutions. The use of VR tools can also mitigate some of the 
      drawbacks currently associated with providing medical training in a traditional 
      clinical environment such as scheduling conflicts and the need for specialized 
      equipment (e.g., high-fidelity manikins). This paper presents the details of the 
      framework and the development methodology associated with a VR-based training 
      simulator for advanced cardiac life support, a time critical, team-based medical 
      scenario. In addition, we also report the key findings of a usability study 
      conducted to assess the efficacy of various features of this VR simulator through 
      a postuse questionnaire administered to various care providers. The usability 
      questionnaires were completed by two groups that used two different versions of 
      the VR simulator. One version consisted of the VR trainer with it all its 
      features and a minified version with certain immersive features disabled. We 
      found an increase in usability scores from the minified group to the full VR 
      group.

TI  - Virtual reality for pain management in cardiac surgery.
PG  - 371-8
LID - 10.1089/cyber.2014.0198 [doi]
AB  - Surgical anxiety creates psychological and physiological stress, causes 
      complications in surgical procedures, and prolongs recovery. Relaxation of 
      patients in postoperative intensive care units can moderate patient vital signs 
      and reduce discomfort. This experiment explores the use of virtual reality (VR) 
      cybertherapy to reduce postoperative distress in patients that have recently 
      undergone cardiac surgery. Sixty-seven patients were monitored at IMSS La Raza 
      National Medical Center within 24 hours of cardiac surgery. Patients navigated 
      through a 30 minute VR simulation designed for pain management. Results were 
      analyzed through comparison of pre- and postoperative vital signs and Likert 
      scale survey data. A connection was found in several physiological factors with 
      subjective responses from the Likert scale survey. Heavy positive correlation 
      existed between breathing rate and Likert ratings, and a moderate correlation was 
      found between mean arterial pressure and Likert ratings and heart rate and Likert 
      ratings, all of which indicated lower pain and stress within patients. Further 
      study of these factors resulted in the categorization of patients based upon 
      their vital signs and subjective response, providing a context for the 
      effectiveness of the therapy to specific groups of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High energy trauma is rare and, as a result, training of prehospital 
      care providers often takes place during the real situation, with the patient as 
      the object for the learning process. Such training could instead be carried out 
      in the context of simulation, out of danger for both patients and personnel. The 
      aim of this study was to provide an overview of the development and foci of 
      research on simulation in prehospital care practice. METHODS: An integrative 
      literature review were used. Articles based on quantitative as well as 
      qualitative research methods were included, resulting in a comprehensive overview 
      of existing published research. For published articles to be included in the 
      review, the focus of the article had to be prehospital care providers, in 
      prehospital settings. Furthermore, included articles must target interventions 
      that were carried out in a simulation context. RESULTS: The volume of published 
      research is distributed between 1984- 2012 and across the regions North America, 
      Europe, Oceania, Asia and Middle East. The simulation methods used were manikins, 
      films, images or paper, live actors, animals and virtual reality. The staff 
      categories focused upon were paramedics, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), 
      medical doctors (MDs), nurse and fire fighters. The main topics of published 
      research on simulation with prehospital care providers included: Intubation, 
      Trauma care, Cardiac Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), Ventilation and Triage. 
      CONCLUSION: Simulation were described as a positive training and education method 
      for prehospital medical staff. It provides opportunities to train assessment, 
      treatment and implementation of procedures and devices under realistic 
      conditions. It is crucial that the staff are familiar with and trained on the 
      identified topics, i.e., intubation, trauma care, CPR, ventilation and triage, 
      which all, to a very large degree, constitute prehospital care. Simulation plays 
      an integral role in this. The current state of prehospital care, which this 
      review reveals, includes inadequate skills of prehospital staff regarding 
      ventilation and CPR, on both children and adults, the lack of skills in 
      paediatric resuscitation and the lack of knowledge in assessing and managing 
      burns victims. These circumstances suggest critical areas for further training 
      and research, at both local and global levels.

TI  - Low serum docosahexaenoic acid is associated with progression of coronary 
      atherosclerosis in statin-treated patients with diabetes mellitus: results of the 
      treatment with statin on atheroma regression evaluated by intravascular 
      ultrasound with virtual histology (TRUTH) study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) accelerates plaque progression despite the use 
      of statin therapy. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the 
      determinants of atheroma progression in statin-treated patients with DM. METHODS: 
      Coronary atherosclerosis in nonculprit lesions in a vessel undergoing 
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was evaluated using virtual histology 
      intravascular ultrasound. The study included 50 patients with DM who had been 
      taking statin therapy for 8 months at the time of PCI. RESULTS: Twenty-six 
      patients (52%) showed atheroma progression (progressors) and the remaining 24 
      patients (48%) showed atheroma regression (regressors) after 8 months of 
      follow-up. Fewer progressors than regressors received intensive lipid-lowering 
      therapy with pitavastatin (31% vs. 50%, p = 0.17) and the frequency of insulin 
      use was higher in progressors (31% vs. 13%, p = 0.18). However, neither of these 
      differences reached statistical significance. Risk factor control at baseline and 
      at the 8-month follow-up did not differ between the 2 groups except for serum 
      levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Univariate 
      regression analysis showed that serum EPA (r = -0.317, p = 0.03) and DHA (r = 
      -0.353, p = 0.02) negatively correlated with atheroma progression. Multivariate 
      stepwise regression analysis showed that low serum DHA and pravastatin use were 
      significant independent predictors for atheroma progression during statin therapy 
      (DHA: β = -0.414, type of statin: β = -0.287, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low serum 
      DHA is associated with progression of coronary atherosclerosis in statin-treated 
      patients with DM. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN ID:

TI  - A 3D virtual reality simulator for training of minimally invasive surgery.
PG  - 349-52
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943601 [doi]
AB  - For the last decade, remarkable progress has been made in the field of 
      cardiovascular disease treatment. However, these complex medical procedures 
      require a combination of rich experience and technical skills. In this paper, a 
      3D virtual reality simulator for core skills training in minimally invasive 
      surgery is presented. The system can generate realistic 3D vascular models 
      segmented from patient datasets, including a beating heart, and provide a 
      real-time computation of force and force feedback module for surgical simulation. 
      Instruments, such as a catheter or guide wire, are represented by a multi-body 
      mass-spring model. In addition, a realistic user interface with multiple windows 
      and real-time 3D views are developed. Moreover, the simulator is also provided 
      with a human-machine interaction module that gives doctors the sense of touch 
      during the surgery training, enables them to control the motion of a virtual 
      catheter/guide wire inside a complex vascular model. Experimental results show 
      that the simulator is suitable for minimally invasive surgery training.

TI  - Use of virtual reality gaming systems for children who are critically ill.
PG  - 273-6
LID - 10.3233/PRM-140296 [doi]
AB  - Children who are critically ill are frequently viewed as "too sick" to tolerate 
      physical activity. As a result, these children often fail to develop strength or 
      cardiovascular endurance as compared to typically developing children. Previous 
      reports have shown that early participation in physical activity in is safe and 
      feasible for patients who are critically ill and may result in a shorter length 
      of stay and improved functional outcomes. The use of the virtual reality gaming 
      systems has become a popular form of therapy for children with disabilities and 
      has been supported by a growing body of evidence substantiating its effectiveness 
      with this population. The use of the virtual reality gaming systems in pediatric 
      rehabilitation provides the children with opportunity to participate in an 
      exercise program that is fun, enjoyable, playful, and at the same time 
      beneficial. The integration of those systems in rehabilitation of children who 
      are critically ill is appealing and has the potential to offer the possibility of 
      enhancing physical activities. The lack of training studies involving children 
      who are critically ill makes it difficult to set guidelines on the recommended 
      physical activities and virtual reality gaming systems that is needed to confer 
      health benefits. Several considerations should be taken into account before 
      recommended virtual reality gaming systems as a training program for children who 
      are critically ill. This article highlighted guidelines, limitations and 
      challenges that need to be considered when designing exercise program using 
      virtual reality gaming systems for critically ill children. This information is 
      helpful given the popular use of virtual reality gaming systems in 
      rehabilitation, particularly in children who are critically ill.

TI  - The effect of anatomic variations of circle of Willis on cerebral blood 
      distribution during posture change from supination to standing: a model study.
PG  - 2371-80
LID - 10.3233/BME-141050 [doi]
AB  - The anatomic variation of Circle of Willis (CoW) has great impact on its 
      compensatory capacity during stroke and cerebral ischemia. In the present study, 
      a series of lumped parameter models were developed and used to simulate the 
      effect of postural changes on the cerebral blood flow in ICA stenosis patients 
      with different anatomic variants of the CoW. The results showed that the 
      asymmetric distribution of cerebral blood flow caused by stenosis was attenuated 
      in standing position in complete and half-complete CoW. However, in incomplete 
      CoW, the decrease in blood flow in the ipsilateral cerebral arteries caused by 
      unilateral ICA stenosis was dramatic in both supine and standing positions, a 
      likely result of inadequate collateral circulation within the CoW. In conclusion, 
      the anatomic variation of CoW plays a significant role in maintaining the balance 
      of cerebral blood supply in patients with ICA stenosis, especially during 
      postural change.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Simulation may reduce the risks associated with the complex 
      operations of cardiothoracic surgery and help create a more efficient, thorough, 
      and uniform curriculum for cardiothoracic surgery fellowship. Here, we review the 
      current status of simulation in cardiothoracic surgical training and provide an 
      overview of all simulation models applicable to cardiothoracic surgery that have 
      been published to date. METHODS: We completed a comprehensive search of all 
      publications pertaining to simulation of cardiothoracic surgical procedures by 
      using PubMed. RESULTS: Numerous cardiothoracic surgical simulators at various 
      stages of development, assessment, and commercial manufacturing have been 
      published to date. There is currently a predominance of models simulating 
      coronary artery bypass grafting and bronchoscopy and a relative paucity of 
      simulators of open pulmonary and esophageal procedures. Despite the wide range of 
      simulators available, few models have been formally assessed for validity and 
      educational value. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical simulation is becoming an increasingly 
      important educational tool in training cardiothoracic surgeons. Our next steps 
      forward will be to develop an objective, standardized way to assess surgical 
      simulation training compared with the current apprenticeship model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical simulation has benefited from a surge in interest over the 
      last decade as a result of the increasing need for a change in the traditional 
      apprentice model of teaching surgery. However, despite the recent interest in 
      surgical simulation as an adjunct to surgical training, most of the literature 
      focuses on laparoscopic, endovascular, and endoscopic surgical simulation with 
      very few studies scrutinizing open surgical simulation and its benefit to 
      surgical trainees. The aim of this review is to summarize the current standard of 
      available open surgical simulators and to review the literature on the benefits 
      of open surgical simulation. CURRENT STATE OF OPEN SURGICAL SIMULATION: Open 
      surgical simulators currently used include live animals, cadavers, bench models, 
      virtual reality, and software-based computer simulators. In the current 
      literature, there are 18 different studies (including 6 randomized controlled 
      trials and 12 cohort studies) investigating the efficacy of open surgical 
      simulation using live animal, bench, and cadaveric models in many surgical 
      specialties including general, cardiac, trauma, vascular, urologic, and 
      gynecologic surgery. The current open surgical simulation studies show, in 
      general, a significant benefit of open surgical simulation in developing the 
      surgical skills of surgical trainees. However, these studies have their 
      limitations including a low number of participants, variable assessment 
      standards, and a focus on short-term results often with no follow-up assessment. 
      FUTURE OF OPEN SURGICAL SIMULATION: The skills needed for open surgical 
      procedures are the essential basis that a surgical trainee needs to grasp before 
      attempting more technical procedures such as laparoscopic procedures. In this 
      current climate of medical practice with reduced hours of surgical exposure for 
      trainees and where the patient's safety and outcome is key, open surgical 
      simulation is a promising adjunct to modern surgical training, filling the void 
      between surgeons being trained in a technique and a surgeon achieving fluency in 
      that open surgical procedure. Better quality research is needed into the benefits 
      of open surgical simulation, and this would hopefully stimulate further 
      development of simulators with more accurate and objective assessment tools.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors evaluated the educational benefits of using a 
      first-generation HeartWorks simulator to teach senior anesthesiology residents 
      basic echocardiography skills. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: 
      A single academic medical center (teaching hospital). PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven 
      senior (fourth-year) anesthesiology residents participated in this study. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Groups of 3 senior anesthesiology residents participated in a 
      single 3-hour tutorial in the simulation laboratory in the authors' institution 
      during their cardiothoracic anesthesiology rotation. A cardiothoracic 
      anesthesiology faculty member demonstrated the use of the transesophageal 
      echocardiography (TEE) simulator and instructed the residents on obtaining 
      standard TEE views of normal anatomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Prior to the 
      laboratory session, the residents took an online multiple-choice pretest with 25 
      questions related to safety, probe manipulation, clinical application, and 
      pathology, which was accompanied by echo images of normal cardiac anatomy and 
      video clips of pathology. Three to four weeks after the TEE tutorial, the 
      residents completed an online post-test and evaluation of the teaching session. 
      There was a statistically significant increase in knowledge of normal 
      echocardiographic anatomy (p = 0.04), with an average improvement in normal 
      echocardiographic anatomy scores of 15%. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual reality TEE 
      simulation technology was endorsed strongly by residents, produced a 
      statistically significant improvement in knowledge of normal echocardiographic 
      anatomy, and could be effective for teaching basic echocardiography to 
      anesthesiology residents.

TI  - Biofeedback in rehabilitation.
PG  - 60
LID - 10.1186/1743-0003-10-60 [doi]
AB  - This paper reviews the literature relating to the biofeedback used in physical 
      rehabilitation. The biofeedback methods used in rehabilitation are based on 
      biomechanical measurements and measurements of the physiological systems of the 
      body. The physiological systems of the body which can be measured to provide 
      biofeedback are the neuromuscular system, the respiratory system and the 
      cardiovascular system. Neuromuscular biofeedback methods include electromyography 
      (EMG) biofeedback and real-time ultrasound imaging (RTUS) biofeedback. EMG 
      biofeedback is the most widely investigated method of biofeedback and appears to 
      be effective in the treatment of many musculoskeletal conditions and in post 
      cardiovascular accident (CVA) rehabilitation. RTUS biofeedback has been 
      demonstrated effective in the treatment of low back pain (LBP) and pelvic floor 
      muscle dysfunction. Cardiovascular biofeedback methods have been shown to be 
      effective in the treatment of a number of health conditions such as hypertension, 
      heart failure, asthma, fibromyalgia and even psychological disorders however a 
      systematic review in this field has yet to be conducted. Similarly, the number of 
      large scale studies examining the use of respiratory biofeedback in 
      rehabilitation is limited. Measurements of movement, postural control and force 
      output can be made using a number of different devices and used to deliver 
      biomechanical biofeedback. Inertial based sensing biofeedback is the most widely 
      researched biomechanical biofeedback method, with a number of studies showing it 
      to be effective in improving measures of balance in a number of populations. 
      Other types of biomechanical biofeedback include force plate systems, 
      electrogoniometry, pressure biofeedback and camera based systems however the 
      evidence for these is limited. Biofeedback is generally delivered using visual 
      displays, acoustic or haptic signals, however more recently virtual reality (VR) 
      or exergaming technology have been used as biofeedback signals. VR and exergaming 
      technology have been primarily investigated in post-CVA rehabilitation, however, 
      more recent work has shown this type of biofeedback to be effective in improving 
      exercise technique in musculoskeletal populations. While a number of studies in 
      this area have been conducted, further large scale studies and reviews 
      investigating different biofeedback applications in different clinical 
      populations are required.

AB  - Experimental research on stress recovery in natural environments is limited, as 
      is study of the effect of sounds of nature. After inducing stress by means of a 
      virtual stress test, we explored physiological recovery in two different virtual 
      natural environments (with and without exposure to sounds of nature) and in one 
      control condition. Cardiovascular data and saliva cortisol were collected. 
      Repeated ANOVA measurements indicated parasympathetic activation in the group 
      subjected to sounds of nature in a virtual natural environment, suggesting 
      enhanced stress recovery may occur in such surroundings. The group that recovered 
      in virtual nature without sound and the control group displayed no particular 
      autonomic activation or deactivation. The results demonstrate a potential 
      mechanistic link between nature, the sounds of nature, and stress recovery, and 
      suggest the potential importance of virtual reality as a tool in this research 
      field.

PG  - 6650453
LID - 10.1109/ICORR.2013.6650453 [doi]
AB  - Ankle impairment and lower limb asymmetries in strength and coordination are 
      common symptoms for individuals with selected musculoskeletal and neurological 
      impairments. The virtual reality augmented cycling kit (VRACK) was designed as a 
      compact mechatronics system for lower limb and mobility rehabilitation. The 
      system measures interaction forces and cardiac activity during cycling in a 
      virtual environment. The kinematics measurement was added to the system. Due to 
      the constrained problem definition, the combination of inertial measurement unit 
      (IMU) and Kalman filtering was recruited to compute the optimal pedal angular 
      displacement during dynamic cycling exercise. Using a novel benchmarking method 
      the accuracy of IMU-based kinematics measurement was evaluated. Relatively 
      accurate angular measurements were achieved. The enhanced VRACK system can serve 
      as a rehabilitation device to monitor biomechanical and physiological variables 
      during cycling on a stationary bike.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiac surgery has been the intervention of choice in many cases 
      of cardiovascular diseases. Susceptibility to postoperative complications, 
      cardiac rehabilitation is indicated. Therapeutic resources, such as virtual 
      reality has been helping the rehabilitational process. The aim of the study was 
      to evaluate the use of virtual reality in the functional rehabilitation of 
      patients in the postoperative period. METHODS: Patients were randomized into two 
      groups, Virtual Reality (VRG, n = 30) and Control (CG, n = 30). The response to 
      treatment was assessed through the functional independence measure (FIM), by the 
      6-minute walk test (6MWT) and the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). Evaluations 
      were performed preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: On the first day 
      after surgery, patients in both groups showed decreased functional performance. 
      However, the VRG showed lower reduction (45.712.3) when compared to CG 
      (35.0612.09, P<0.05) in first postoperative day, and no significant difference in 
      performance on discharge day (P>0.05). In evaluating the NHP field, we observed a 
      significant decrease in pain score at third assessment (P<0.05). These patients 
      also had a higher energy level in the first evaluation (P<0.05). There were no 
      differences with statistical significance for emotional reactions, physical 
      ability, and social interaction. The length of stay was significantly shorter in 
      patients of VRG (9.410.5 days vs. 12.2 1 0.9 days, P<0.05), which also had a 
      higher 6MWD (319.9119.3 meters vs. 263.5115.4 meters, P<0.02). CONCLUSION: 
      Adjunctive treatment with virtual reality demonstrated benefits, with better 
      functional performance in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate feasibility, face validity, influence on 
      technical factors and subjective sense of utility of patient-specific rehearsal 
      (PsR) prior to endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). DESIGN: A prospective, 
      multicentre pilot study. METHODS: Patients suitable for EVAR were enrolled and a 
      three-dimensional (3D) model of the patient's anatomy was generated. Less than 24 
      h prior to the real case, rehearsals were conducted in the laboratory or clinical 
      angiosuite. Technical metrics were recorded during both procedures. A subjective 
      questionnaire was used to evaluate realism, technical and human factor aspects 
      (scale 1-5). RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled. In one case, the treatment plan 
      was altered based on PsR. In 7/9 patients, the rehearsal significantly altered 
      the optimal C-arm position for the proximal landing zone and an identical 
      fluoroscopy angle was chosen in the real procedure. All team members found the 
      rehearsal useful for selecting the optimal fluoroscopy angle (median 4). The 
      realism of the EVAR procedure simulation was rated highly (median 4). All team 
      members found the PsR useful to prepare the individual team members and the 
      entire team (median 4). CONCLUSIONS: PsR for EVAR permits creation of realistic 
      case studies. Subjective evaluation indicates that it may influence optimal C-arm 
      angles and be valuable to prepare the entire team. A randomised controlled trial 
      (RCT) is planned to evaluate how this technology may influence technical and team 
      performance, ultimately leading to improved patient safety.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Outcome after cardiac arrest is dependent on the quality of chest 
      compressions (CC). A great number of devices have been developed to provide 
      guidance during CPR. The present study evaluates a new CPR feedback system 
      (Mini-VREM: Mini-Virtual Reality Enhanced Mannequin) designed to improve CC 
      during training. METHODS: Mini-VREM system consists of a Kinect(®) (Microsoft, 
      Redmond, WA, USA) motion sensing device and specifically developed software to 
      provide audio-visual feedback. Mini-VREM was connected to a commercially 
      available mannequin (Laerdal Medical, Stavanger, Norway). Eighty trainees 
      (healthcare professionals and lay people) volunteered in this randomised 
      crossover pilot study. All subjects performed a 2 min CC trial, 1h pause and a 
      second 2 min CC trial. The first group (FB/NFB, n=40) performed CC with Mini-VREM 
      feedback (FB) followed by CC without feedback (NFB). The second group (NFB/FB, 
      n=40) performed vice versa. Primary endpoints: adequate compression (compression 
      rate between 100 and 120 min(-1) and compression depth between 50 and 60mm); 
      compressions rate within 100-120 min(-1); compressions depth within 50-60mm. 
      RESULTS: When compared to the performance without feedback, with Mini-VREM 
      feedback compressions were more adequate (FB 35.78% vs. NFB 7.27%, p<0.001) and 
      more compressions achieved target rate (FB 72.04% vs. 31.42%, p<0.001) and target 
      depth (FB 47.34% vs. 24.87%, p=0.002). The participants perceived the system to 
      be easy to use with effective feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The Mini-VREM system was 
      able to improve significantly the CC performance by healthcare professionals and 
      by lay people in a simulated CA scenario, in terms of compression rate and depth.

TI  - Improving results for carotid artery stenting by validation of the anatomic 
      scoring system for carotid artery stenting with patient-specific simulated 
      rehearsal.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a technically demanding procedure 
      with a risk of periprocedural stroke. A scoring system based on anatomic criteria 
      has been developed to facilitate patient selection for CAS. Advancements in 
      simulation science also enable case evaluation through patient-specific virtual 
      reality (VR) rehearsal on an endovascular simulator. This study aimed to validate 
      the anatomic scoring system for CAS using the patient-specific VR technology. 
      METHODS: Three patients were selected and graded according to the CAS scoring 
      system (maximum score, 9): one easy (score, <4.9), one intermediate (score, 
      5.0-5.9), and one difficult (score, >7.0). The three cases were performed on the 
      simulator in random order by 20 novice interventionalists pretrained in CAS. 
      Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics and 
      expert-based ratings. RESULTS: The interventionalists took significantly longer 
      to perform the difficult CAS case (median, 31.6 vs 19.7 vs 14.6 minutes; P<.0001) 
      compared with the intermediate and easy cases; similarly, more fluoroscopy time 
      (20.7 vs 12.1 vs 8.2 minutes; P<.0001), contrast volume (56.5 vs 51.5 vs 50.0 mL; 
      P=.0060), and roadmaps (10 vs 9 vs 9; P=.0040) were used. The quality of 
      performance declined significantly as the cases became more challenging (score, 
      24 vs 22 vs 19; P<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The anatomic scoring system for CAS can 
      predict the difficulty of a CAS procedure as measured by patient-specific VR. 
      This scoring system, with or without the additional use of patient-specific VR, 
      can guide novice interventionalists in selecting appropriate patients for CAS. 
      This may reduce the perioperative stroke risk and enhance patient safety.

TI  - Mentored simulation training improves procedural skills in cardiac 
      catheterization: a randomized, controlled pilot study.
PG  - 672-9
LID - 10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.112.970772 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite valuable supplemental training resources for surgical skill 
      acquisition, utility of virtual reality simulators to improve skills relevant to 
      performing cardiac catheterization has not been evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      Post baseline cardiac catheterization performance assessment, 27 cardiology 
      trainees were randomized to either mentored training on a virtual reality 
      simulator (n=12) or no simulator training (control; n=15). Cardiac 
      catheterization performance was reassessed 1 week post baseline assessment. 
      Performance scores at 1 week were compared with baseline within each group, and 
      change in score from baseline to 1 week was compared between groups. Linear 
      regression modeling was performed to assess the effect of simulator training as a 
      function of baseline performance. Technical performance improved postintervention 
      in the simulator group (24 versus 18; P=0.008) and changed marginally in the 
      control group (20 versus 18; P=0.054). Improvement in technical performance was 
      greater in the simulator group (6 versus 1; P=0.04). Global performance improved 
      postintervention in both groups (simulator, 24 versus 17, P=0.01; control, 20 
      versus 18, P=0.02), with a trend toward greater improvement in the simulator 
      group (5 versus 2; P=0.11). Lower scores at baseline were associated with larger 
      differences in postintervention scores between the simulator and control groups 
      (technical performance, P=0.0006; global performance, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Skills required to perform cardiac catheterization can be learned via mentored 
      simulation training and are transferable to actual procedures in the 
      catheterization laboratory. Less proficient operators derive greater benefit from 
      simulator training than more proficient operators.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the face and content validity of a novel, full physics, full 
      procedural, virtual reality simulation housed in a hybrid procedure suite. 
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: After completing 60 minutes of hands-on training in 
      uterine artery embolization and coronary angioplasty, 24 radiologists and 18 
      cardiologists with mean 10 years of endovascular experience assessed the 
      functionality of a comprehensive hybrid procedure suite simulation (Orcamp; 
      Orzone, Gothenburg, Sweden). RESULTS: C-arm and operating table functionality and 
      realism were reliably (α = 0.0.89-0.92) rated highly (80/100). Performance 
      realism of the catheter, guide wire, fluoroscopy image, electrocardiogram, and 
      vital signs readout also reliably and statistically significantly predicted 
      subjects' overall positive assessment (mean = 87/100) of the simulation 
      experience in a multiple regression model (α = .83; r = 0.85 and r(2) = 0.67; P < 
      .0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a quantitative evaluation of a 
      comprehensive simulation of an authentic procedure suite for image-guided 
      intravascular procedures. This new facility affords the opportunity for trainers 
      to provide higher fidelity training of operative technical, procedural, and 
      management skills in the realistic context of a complete procedure suite with all 
      its complexities and potential distractions.

TI  - Three-dimensional modelling of the venous system by direct multislice helical 
      computed tomography venography: technique, indications and results.
PG  - 270-88
LID - 10.1258/phleb.2012.012J07 [doi]
AB  - The aim of multislice helical computed tomography venography (CTV) is to provide 
      a precise, global and three-dimensional (3D) anatomical depiction of the venous 
      network of the lower limbs. A multislice and multidetector spiral CT acquisition 
      of the lower limbs with contrast injection of the dorsal foot produces about 1000 
      slices in 30 seconds. Dedicated volume-rendering software can compute a realistic 
      and interactive 3D model of the venous system in realtime. This new tool 
      furnishes an accurate 3D representation of the whole venous system of the lower 
      limb with a realistic 3D model of the limbs, providing a road map of the varicose 
      networks complementary to the duplex ultrasound (DUS). CTV allows a complete 
      morphological study of the deep veins, including the detection of anatomical 
      variations and proximal venous obstruction, not easily detectable by DUS. In the 
      case of deep vein thrombosis, it has been shown to be a good diagnostic tool, 
      well correlated with sonography. It also demonstrates, in some cases, 
      haemodynamic patterns which are not available by DUS, particularly for perforator 
      veins and congenital vascular malformations. The use of virtual reality 
      techniques enables a complete anatomical study of both deep and superficial veins 
      including a virtual dissection of the limbs. CTV is also a great educational tool 
      to learn anatomy of the venous system and a powerful research tool to improve our 
      knowledge of venous anatomy.

TI  - The future of simulation technologies for complex cardiovascular procedures.
PG  - 2127-34
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehs155 [doi]
AB  - Changing work practices and the evolution of more complex interventions in 
      cardiovascular medicine are forcing a paradigm shift in the way doctors are 
      trained. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), transcatheter aortic valve 
      implantation (TAVI), carotid artery stenting (CAS), and acute stroke intervention 
      procedures are forcing these changes at a faster pace than in other disciplines. 
      As a consequence, cardiovascular medicine has had to develop a sophisticated 
      understanding of precisely what is meant by 'training' and 'skill'. An evolving 
      conclusion is that procedure training on a virtual reality (VR) simulator 
      presents a viable current solution. These simulations should characterize the 
      important performance characteristics of procedural skill that have metrics 
      derived and defined from, and then benchmarked to experienced operators (i.e. 
      level of proficiency). Simulation training is optimal with metric-based feedback, 
      particularly formative trainee error assessments, proximate to their performance. 
      In prospective, randomized studies, learners who trained to a benchmarked 
      proficiency level on the simulator performed significantly better than learners 
      who were traditionally trained. In addition, cardiovascular medicine now has 
      available the most sophisticated virtual reality simulators in medicine and these 
      have been used for the roll-out of interventions such as CAS in the USA and 
      globally with cardiovascular society and industry partnered training programmes. 
      The Food and Drug Administration has advocated the use of VR simulation as part 
      of the approval of new devices and the American Board of Internal Medicine has 
      adopted simulation as part of its maintenance of certification. Simulation is 
      rapidly becoming a mainstay of cardiovascular education, training, certification, 
      and the safe adoption of new technology. If cardiovascular medicine is to 
      continue to lead in the adoption and integration of simulation, then, it must 
      take a proactive position in the development of metric-based simulation 
      curriculum, adoption of proficiency benchmarking definitions, and then resolve to 
      commit resources so as to continue to lead this revolution in physician training.

TI  - In vitro three-dimensional aortic vasculature modeling based on sensor fusion 
      between intravascular ultrasound and magnetic tracker.
PG  - 291-9
LID - 10.1002/rcs.1416 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is desirable to reduce aortic stent graft installation time and 
      the amount of contrast media used for this process. Guidance with augmented 
      reality can achieve this by facilitating alignment of the stent graft with the 
      renal and mesenteric arteries. METHODS: For this purpose, a sensor fusion is 
      proposed between intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and magnetic trackers to 
      construct three-dimensional virtual reality models of the blood vessels, as well 
      as improvements to the gradient vector flow snake for boundary detection in 
      ultrasound images. In vitro vasculature imaging experiments were done with hybrid 
      probe and silicone models of the vasculature. RESULTS: The dispersion of samples 
      for the magnetic tracker in the hybrid probe increased less than 1 mm when the 
      IVUS was activated. Three-dimensional models of the descending thoracic aorta, 
      with cross-section radius average error of 0.94 mm, were built from the data 
      fusion. CONCLUSION: The development of this technology will enable reduction in 
      the amount of contrast media required for in vivo and real-time three-dimensional 
      blood vessel imaging.

TI  - A stable and real-time nonlinear elastic approach to simulating guidewire and 
      catheter insertions based on Cosserat rod.
PG  - 2211-8
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2012.2199319 [doi]
AB  - Interventional Radiology procedures (e.g., angioplasty, embolization, stent graft 
      placement) provide minimally invasive therapy to treat a wide range of 
      conditions. These procedures involve the use of flexible tipped guidewires to 
      advance diagnostic or therapeutic catheters into a patient's vascular or visceral 
      anatomy. This paper presents a real-time physically based hybrid modeling 
      approach to simulating guidewire insertions. The long, slender body of the 
      guidewire shaft is simulated using nonlinear elastic Cosserat rods, and the 
      shorter flexible tip composed of a straight, curved, or angled design is modeled 
      using a more efficient generalized bending model. Therefore, the proposed 
      approach efficiently computes intrinsic dynamic behaviors of guidewire 
      interactions within vascular structures. The efficacy of the proposed method is 
      demonstrated using detailed numerical simulations inside 3-D blood vessel 
      structures derived from preprocedural volumetric data. A validation study 
      compares positions of four physical guidewires deployed within a vascular 
      phantom, with the co-ordinates of the corresponding simulated guidewires within a 
      virtual model of the phantom. An optimization algorithm is also implemented to 
      further improve the accuracy of the simulation. The presented simulation model is 
      suitable for interactive virtual reality-based training and for treatment 
      planning.

TI  - Simulated procedure rehearsal is more effective than a preoperative generic 
      warm-up for endovascular procedures.
PG  - 1184-9
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0b013e31824f9dbf [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patient-specific simulated rehearsal (PsR) of a carotid artery 
      stenting procedure (CAS) enables the interventionalist to rehearse the case 
      before performing the procedure on the actual patient by incorporating 
      patient-specific computed tomographic data into the simulation software. This 
      study aimed to evaluate whether PsR of a CAS procedure can enhance the operative 
      performance versus a virtual reality (VR) generic CAS warm-up procedure or no 
      preparation at all. METHODS: During a 10-session cognitive/technical VR course, 
      medical residents were trained in CAS. Thereafter, in a randomized crossover 
      study, each participant performed a patient-specific CAS case 3 times on the 
      simulator, preceded by 3 different tasks: a PsR, a generic case, or no 
      preparation. Technical performances were assessed using simulator-based metrics 
      and expert-based ratings. RESULTS: Twenty medical residents (surgery, cardiology, 
      radiology) were recruited. Training plateaus were observed after 10 sessions for 
      all participants. Performances were significantly better after PsR than after a 
      generic warm-up or no warm-up for total procedure time (16.3 ± 0.6 vs 19.7 ± 1.0 
      vs 20.9 ± 1.1 minutes, P = 0.001) and fluoroscopy time (9.3 ± 0.1 vs 11.2 ± 0.6 
      vs 11.2 ± 0.5 minutes, P = 0.022) but did not influence contrast volume or number 
      of roadmaps used during the "real" case. PsR significantly improved the quality 
      of performance as measured by the expert-based ratings (scores 28 vs 25 vs 25, P 
      = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: Patient-specific simulated rehearsal of a CAS procedure 
      significantly improves operative performance, compared to a generic VR warm-up or 
      no warm-up. This technology requires further investigation with respect to 
      improved outcomes on patients in the clinical setting.

AB  - Simulation for perfusion education has been used for at least the past 25 years. 
      The earlier models were either electronic (computer games) or fluid dynamic 
      models and provided invaluable adjuncts to perfusion training and education. In 
      2009, the *North Shore-LIJ Health System at Great Neck, New York, opened an 
      innovative "Bioskill Center" dedicated to simulated virtual reality advanced 
      hands-on surgical training as well as perfusion simulation. Professional cardiac 
      surgical organizations now show great interest in using simulation for training 
      and recertification. Simulation will continue to be the direction for future 
      perfusion training and education. This manuscript introduces a cost-effective 
      system developed from discarded perfusion products and it is not intended to 
      detail the actual lengthy process of its construction.

TI  - [Improved quality of coronary diagnostics and interventions by virtual reality 
      simulation].
PG  - 430-5
LID - 10.1007/s00059-011-3488-6 [doi]
AB  - Currently, more than 800,000 diagnostic procedures and 300,000 percutaneous 
      coronary interventions are performed annually in 556 catheter laboratories in 
      Germany. These numbers document the importance of training programs in 
      interventional cardiology. However, this need is in sharp contrast to the time 
      constraints for continuing medical education in Germany due to personnel and 
      financial restrictions. A possible solution for this dilemma could be new 
      training programs which partially supplement conventional clinical training by 
      simulation-based medical education. Currently five virtual reality simulators for 
      diagnostic procedures and percutaneous coronary interventions are available. 
      These simulators provide a realistic hands-on training comparable to flight 
      simulation in aviation.The simulator of choice for a defined training program 
      depending on the underlying learning objectives could either be a simple 
      mechanical model (for puncture training) or even a combination of virtual reality 
      simulator and a full-scale mannequin (for team training and crisis resource 
      management). For the selection of the adequate training program the basic skills 
      of the trainee, the learning objectives and the underlying curriculum have to be 
      taken into account. Absolutely mandatory for the success of simulation-based 
      training is a dedicated teacher providing feedback and guidance. This teacher 
      should be an experienced interventional cardiologist who knows both the simulator 
      and the selected training cases which serve as a vehicle for transferring 
      knowledge and skills.In this paper the potential of virtual reality simulation in 
      cardiology will be discussed and the conditions which must be fulfilled to 
      achieve quality improvement by simulation-based training will be defined.

TI  - Efficient implementation of patient-specific simulated rehearsal for the carotid 
      artery stenting procedure: part-task rehearsal.
PG  - 158-66
LID - 10.1016/j.ejvs.2011.03.032 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): Patient-specific simulated rehearsal (PsR) is a technological 
      advance within the domain of endovascular virtual reality (VR) simulation. It 
      allows incorporation of patient-specific computed tomography Digital Imaging and 
      Communications in Medicine (CT DICOM) data into the simulation and subsequent 
      rehearsal of real patient cases. This study aimed to evaluate whether a part-task 
      rehearsal (PTr) of a carotid artery stenting procedure (CAS) on a VR simulator is 
      as effective as a full-task (FTr) preoperative run through. METHODS: Medical 
      trainees were trained in the CAS procedure and randomised to a PTr or FTr of a 
      challenging CAS case (Type-II arch). PTr consisted of 30 min of repeated 
      catheterisations of the common carotid artery (CCA). Thereafter, both groups 
      performed the CAS procedure in a fully functional simulated operating suite (SOS) 
      with an interventional team. Technical performances were assessed using 
      simulator-based metrics and expert ratings. Other aspects of performance were 
      assessed using the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) scoring. RESULTS: 
      Twenty trainees were evenly randomised to either PTr or FTr. No differences in 
      performance were seen except for the total time the embolic protection device 
      (EPD) was deployed (9.4 min for the PT vs. 8.1 min for the FT, p = 0.02). Total 
      time (26.3 vs. 25.5 min, p = 0.94), fluoroscopy time (15.8 vs. 14.4 min, p = 
      0.68), number of roadmaps (10.5 vs. 11.0, p = 0.54), amount of contrast (53.5 vs. 
      58.0 ml, p = 0.33), time to deploy the EPD (0.9 vs. 0.8 min, p = 0.31) and time 
      to catheterise the CCA (9.2 vs. 8.9 min, p = 0.94) were similar. Qualitative 
      performances as measured by expert ratings (score 24 vs. 24, p = 0.49) and NOTSS 
      (p > 0.05 for all categories) were also comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Part- and 
      full-task rehearsals are equally effective with respect to the operative 
      performance of a simulated CAS intervention. This finding makes a 
      patient-specific rehearsal more efficient and may increase the feasibility of 
      implementation of this technology into medical practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare the performance of electrophysiology 
      fellows in transseptal catheterization (TSP-C) after conventional (Conv-T) or 
      simulator training (Sim-T). BACKGROUND: Current training for TSP-C, an 
      increasingly used procedure, relies on performance on patients with supervision 
      by an experienced operator. Virtual reality, a new training option, could improve 
      post-training performance. METHODS: Fellows inexperienced in TSP-C were enrolled 
      and randomly assigned to Conv-T or Sim-T. The post-training performance of each 
      fellow was evaluated and scored in 3 consecutive patient-based procedures by an 
      experienced operator blinded to the fellow's training assignment. RESULTS: 
      Fourteen fellows were randomized to Conv-T (n = 7) or to Sim-T (n = 7) and, after 
      training, performed 42 TSP-Cs independently. Training time was significantly 
      longer for Conv-T than for Sim-T (median 30 days vs. 4 days; p = 0.0175). The 
      Conv-T fellows had significantly lower post-training performance scores (median 
      68 vs. 95; p = 0.0001) and a higher number of recurrent errors (median 3 vs. 0; p 
      = 0.0006) when compared with Sim-T fellows. CONCLUSIONS: The TSP-C training with 
      virtual reality results in shorter training times and superior post-training 
      performance.

AB  - Stroke is a common, serious, and disabling global health-care problem, and 
      rehabilitation is a major part of patient care. There is evidence to support 
      rehabilitation in well coordinated multidisciplinary stroke units or through 
      provision of early supported provision of discharge teams. Potentially beneficial 
      treatment options for motor recovery of the arm include constraint-induced 
      movement therapy and robotics. Promising interventions that could be beneficial 
      to improve aspects of gait include fitness training, high-intensity therapy, and 
      repetitive-task training. Repetitive-task training might also improve transfer 
      functions. Occupational therapy can improve activities of daily living; however, 
      information about the clinical effect of various strategies of cognitive 
      rehabilitation and strategies for aphasia and dysarthria is scarce. Several large 
      trials of rehabilitation practice and of novel therapies (eg, stem-cell therapy, 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, virtual reality, robotic therapies, 
      and drug augmentation) are underway to inform future practice.

TI  - Surgeon's vigilance in the operating room.
PG  - 673-7
LID - 10.1016/j.amjsurg.2011.01.016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surgeons' vigilance regarding patient condition was assessed using 
      eye-tracking techniques during a simulated laparoscopic procedure. METHODS: 
      Surgeons were required to perform a partial cholecystectomy in a virtual reality 
      trainer (SurgicalSim; METI Inc, Sarasota, FL) while wearing a lightweight 
      head-mounted eye-tracker (Locarna systems Inc, Victoria, British Columbia, 
      Canada). Half of the patients were preprogrammed to present a mildly unstable 
      cardiac condition during the procedure. Surgical performance (evaluated by task 
      time, instrument trajectory, and errors), mental workload (by the National 
      Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index), and eye movement were 
      recorded and compared between 13 experienced and 10 novice surgeons. RESULTS: 
      Experienced surgeons took longer to complete the task and also made more errors. 
      The overall workload reported by surgeons was similar, but expert surgeons 
      reported a higher level of frustration and a lower level of physical demands. 
      Surgeon workload was greater when operating on the unstable patient than on the 
      stable patient. Novices performed faster but focused more of their attention on 
      the surgical task. In contrast, experts glanced more frequently at the anesthetic 
      monitor. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the usefulness of using eye-tracking 
      technology to measure a surgeon's vigilance during an operation. Eye-tracking 
      observations can lead to inferences about a surgeon's behavior for patient 
      safety. The unsatisfactory performance of expert surgeons on the VR simulator 
      suggests that the fidelity of the virtual simulator needs to improve to enable 
      surgeons to transfer their clinical skills. This, in turn, suggests using caution 
      when having clinical experts as instructors to teach skills with virtual 
      simulators.

TI  - Patient-specific endovascular simulation influences interventionalists performing 
      carotid artery stenting procedures.
PG  - 492-500

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The ability to perform patient-specific simulated rehearsal of complex 
      endovascular interventions is a technological advance with potential benefits to 
      patient outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate whether patient-specific rehearsal 
      of a carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedure has an influence on tool selection 
      and the use of fluoroscopy. METHODS: Following case note and computed tomography 
      (CT) angiographic review of a real patient case, subjects performed the CAS 
      procedure on a virtual reality simulator. Endovascular tool requirements and 
      fluoroscopic angles were evaluated with a pre- and post-case questionnaire. 
      Participants also rated the simulation from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). RESULTS: 
      Thirty-three endovascular physicians with varying degrees of CAS experience were 
      recruited: inexperienced (5-20 CAS procedures) n = 11, moderately (21-50 CAS 
      procedures) n = 7 or highly experienced (>50 CAS procedures) n = 15. For all 
      participants, 96 of a possible 363 changes (26%) were observed from pre- to 
      post-case questionnaires. This was most notable for optimal fluoroscopy C-arm 
      position 15/33 (46%), choice of selective catheter 13/33 (39%), choice of sheath 
      or guiding catheter 11/33 (33%) and balloon dilatation strategy 10/33 (30%). 
      Experience with the CAS procedure did not influence the degree of change 
      significantly (p > 0.05), and all groups exhibited a considerable modification in 
      tool and fluoroscopy preference. The model was considered realistic and useful as 
      a tool to practice a real case (median score 4/5). CONCLUSION: Patient-specific 
      simulated rehearsal of a complex endovascular procedure strongly influences tool 
      selection and fluoroscopy preferences for the real case. Further research has to 
      evaluate how this technology may transfer from in vitro to in vivo and if it can 
      reduce the radiation dose and the number of endovascular tools used and improve 
      outcomes for patients in the clinical setting.

TI  - Virtual reality technologies for research and education in obesity and diabetes: 
      research needs and opportunities.
PG  - 212-24
AB  - The rising rates, high prevalence, and adverse consequences of obesity and 
      diabetes call for new approaches to the complex behaviors needed to prevent and 
      manage these conditions. Virtual reality (VR) technologies, which provide 
      controllable, multisensory, interactive three-dimensional (3D) stimulus 
      environments, are a potentially valuable means of engaging patients in 
      interventions that foster more healthful eating and physical activity patterns. 
      Furthermore, the capacity of VR technologies to motivate, record, and measure 
      human performance represents a novel and useful modality for conducting research. 
      This article summarizes background information and discussions for a joint July 
      2010 National Institutes of Health - Department of Defense workshop entitled 
      Virtual Reality Technologies for Research and Education in Obesity and Diabetes. 
      The workshop explored the research potential of VR technologies as tools for 
      behavioral and neuroscience studies in diabetes and obesity, and the practical 
      potential of VR in fostering more effective utilization of diabetes- and 
      obesity-related nutrition and lifestyle information. Virtual reality technologies 
      were considered especially relevant for fostering desirable health-related 
      behaviors through motivational reinforcement, personalized teaching approaches, 
      and social networking. Virtual reality might also be a means of extending the 
      availability and capacity of health care providers. Progress in the field will be 
      enhanced by further developing available platforms and taking advantage of VR's 
      capabilities as a research tool for well-designed hypothesis-testing behavioral 
      science. Multidisciplinary collaborations are needed between the technology 
      industry and academia, and among researchers in biomedical, behavioral, 
      pedagogical, and computer science disciplines. Research priorities and funding 
      opportunities for use of VR to improve prevention and management of obesity and 
      diabetes can be found at agency websites (National Institutes of Health: 
      http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/index.html; Department of Defense:

TI  - Mental practice: effective stress management training for novice surgeons.
PG  - 225-33
LID - 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2010.09.025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgeons are often subject to excessive levels of acute stress that 
      can impair their performance. Mental practice (MP) is a strategy used in other 
      high-performance industries to alleviate anxiety. This study investigated if MP 
      reduces stress in novice surgeons. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized 
      controlled design was used with 20 novice surgeons recruited by random sampling. 
      After baseline testing, participants underwent training on an evidence-based 
      virtual reality (VR) curriculum. They then performed 5 VR laparoscopic 
      cholecystectomies (LC) after being randomized to MP or control groups. The MP 
      group performed 30 minutes of MP using a validated MP training protocol before 
      each LC; control participants conducted an unrelated activity. Stress was 
      assessed subjectively using the validated State-Trait Anxiety-Inventory (STAI) 
      questionnaire and objectively with a continuous heart rate (HR) monitor and 
      salivary cortisol. Mental imagery was assessed using the validated mental imagery 
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Eighteen participants completed the study. There were no 
      intergroup differences in baseline stress, imagery, or technical ability. 
      Comparing the MP group with controls, subjective stress (STAI) was lower for the 
      MP group (median 8.40 vs 11.31, p < 0.01). Objective stress was also 
      significantly reduced for the MP group in terms of the average HR (median 72 vs 
      88 beats/minute, p < 0.0001), maximum HR (median 102 vs 119 beats/minute, p < 
      0.01), and cortisol (median 2.26 vs 3.85 nmol/L, p < 0.05). Significant negative 
      correlations were obtained between stress and imagery, indicating that improved 
      imagery was associated with lower stress (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A short period 
      of MP reduces the subjective, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine response to 
      stress on a VR simulator. Additional research should determine whether this 
      effect extends beyond novice surgeons and transfers to the operating room.

TI  - Training with simulation versus operative room attendance.
PG  - 17-37
AB  - Reduced training times, increasing complexity of endovascular and open vascular 
      interventions and concerns for patient's safety have necessitated a modernisation 
      in surgical training. A more strategic approach is required to facilitate the 
      acquisition of surgical skills outside the operating room and to minimize the 
      risks to patients as surgeons develop their technical expertise. Virtual reality 
      simulation has been proposed as a means to train and objectively assess technical 
      endovascular performance without risks to patient safety. This article reviews 
      the evidence and the limitations for this adjunctive tool, the implementation in 
      current training programmes and future applications to maintain the highest 
      standards of care for treatment of vascular disease.

TI  - A novel virtual reality environment for preoperative planning and simulation of 
      image guided intracardiac surgeries with robotic manipulators.
PG  - 716-22
AB  - The evolution of image-guided and robot-assisted procedures can be beneficial to 
      intracardiac interventions. This paper proposes a novel approach and a virtual 
      reality system for preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance of cardiac 
      procedures, and for investigating the kinematics and control of a virtual robotic 
      manipulator, based on MRI CINE images. The system incorporates dedicated software 
      modules for processing MR images, generating dynamic trajectories in the 
      continuously changing environment of a beating heart, controlling a specific 
      generic virtual manipulator along those trajectories, and a virtual reality 
      interface that fuses all those information. The proposed system is applied for 
      the simulation of accessing the aortic valve annulus via a small incision on the 
      apex by maneuvering a robotic manipulator through an access corridor that safely 
      transverses the left ventricle (LV) of the beating heart.

TI  - Simulating video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy: a virtual reality cognitive 
      task simulation.
PG  - 249-55
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.09.014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery training models rely on 
      animals or mannequins to teach procedural skills. These approaches lack inherent 
      teaching/testing capability and are limited by cost, anatomic variations, and 
      single use. In response, we hypothesized that video-assisted thoracoscopic 
      surgery right upper lobe resection could be simulated in a virtual reality 
      environment with commercial software. METHODS: An anatomy explorer (Maya 
      [Autodesk Inc, San Rafael, Calif] models of the chest and hilar structures) and 
      simulation engine were adapted. Design goals included freedom of port placement, 
      incorporation of well-known anatomic variants, teaching and testing modes, haptic 
      feedback for the dissection, ability to perform the anatomic divisions, and a 
      portable platform. RESULTS: Preexisting commercial models did not provide 
      sufficient surgical detail, and extensive modeling modifications were required. 
      Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery right upper lobe resection simulation is 
      initiated with a random vein and artery variation. The trainee proceeds in a 
      teaching or testing mode. A knowledge database currently includes 13 anatomic 
      identifications and 20 high-yield lung cancer learning points. The "patient" is 
      presented in the left lateral decubitus position. After initial camera port 
      placement, the endoscopic view is displayed and the thoracoscope is manipulated 
      via the haptic device. The thoracoscope port can be relocated; additional ports 
      are placed using an external "operating room" view. Unrestricted endoscopic 
      exploration of the thorax is allowed. An endo-dissector tool allows for hilar 
      dissection, and a virtual stapling device divides structures. The trainee's 
      performance is reported. CONCLUSIONS: A virtual reality cognitive task simulation 
      can overcome the deficiencies of existing training models. Performance scoring is 
      being validated as we assess this simulator for cognitive and technical surgical 
      education.

TI  - Three-dimensional echocardiographic virtual endoscopy for the diagnosis of 
      congenital heart disease in children.
PG  - 851-9
LID - 10.1007/s10554-010-9649-5 [doi]
AB  - Virtual endoscopy (VE) is a new post-processing method that uses volumetric data 
      sets to simulate the tracks of a "conventional" flexible endoscope. However, 
      almost all studies of this method have involved virtual visualizations of the 
      cardiovascular structures applied to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic 
      resonance (MR) datasets. This paper introduces a novel visualization method 
      called the "three-dimensional echocardiographic intracardiac endoscopic 
      simulation system (3DE IESS)", which uses 3D echocardiographic images in a 
      virtual reality (VR) environment to diagnose congenital heart disease. The aim of 
      this study was to analyze the feasibility of VE in the evaluation of congenital 
      heart disease in children and its accuracy compared with 2DE. Three experienced 
      pediatric cardiologists blinded to the patients' diagnoses separately reviewed 40 
      two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE) datasets and 40 corresponding VE datasets 
      and judged whether abnormal intracardiac anatomy was present in terms of a 
      five-point scale (1 = definitely absent; 2 = probably absent; 3 = cannot be 
      determined; 4 = probably present; and 5 = definitely present). Compared with 
      clinical diagnosis, the diagnostic accuracy of VE was 98.7% for ASD, 92.4% for 
      VSD, 92.6% for TOF, and 94% for DORV, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy of VE was 
      significantly higher than that of 2DE for TOF and DORV except for ASD and VSD. 
      The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for VE was closer to the 
      optimal performance point than was the ROC curve for 2DE. The area under the ROC 
      curve was 0.96 for VE and 0.93 for 2DE. Kappa values (range, 0.73-0.79) for VE 
      and 2DE indicated substantial agreement. 3D echocardiographic VE can enhance our 
      understanding of intracardiac structures and facilitate the evaluation of 
      congenital heart disease.

TI  - Methamphetamine craving induced in an online virtual reality environment.
PG  - 454-60
LID - 10.1016/j.pbb.2010.07.005 [doi]
AB  - The main aim of this study was to assess self-reported craving and physiological 
      reactivity in a methamphetamine virtual reality (METH-VR) cue model created using 
      Second Life, a freely available online gaming platform. Seventeen, non-treatment 
      seeking, individuals that abuse methamphetamine (METH) completed this 1-day, 
      outpatient, within-subjects study. Participants completed four test sessions: 1) 
      METH-VR, 2) neutral-VR, 3) METH-video, and 4) neutral-video in a counterbalanced 
      (Latin square) fashion. The participants provided subjective ratings of urges to 
      use METH, mood, and physical state throughout each cue presentation. Measures of 
      physiological reactivity (heart rate variability) were also collected during each 
      cue presentation and at rest. The METH-VR condition elicited the greatest change 
      in subjective reports of "crave METH", "desire METH", and "want METH" at all time 
      points. The "high craving" participants displayed more high frequency 
      cardiovascular activity while the "low craving" participants displayed more low 
      frequency cardiovascular activity during the cue conditions, with the greatest 
      difference seen during the METH-VR and METH-video cues. These findings reveal a 
      physiological divergence between high and low craving METH abusers using heart 
      rate variability, and demonstrate the usefulness of VR cues for eliciting 
      subjective craving in METH abusers, as well as the effectiveness of a novel VR 
      drug cue model created within an online virtual world.

TI  - Cardiovascular and cortisol reactivity and habituation to a virtual reality 
      version of the Trier Social Stress Test: a pilot study.
PG  - 1397-403
LID - 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.04.003 [doi]
AB  - The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is a widely used protocol to induce stress in 
      laboratory settings. Briefly, in the TSST, the test participant is asked to hold 
      a speech and to do an arithmetic task in front of an audience. In the present 
      pilot study, we examined endocrine and autonomic reactivity and habituation to 
      repeated stress provocations using a virtual reality (VR) version of TSST. The VR 
      system was a CAVE™ system with three rear projected walls (4 m×3 m), and one 
      floor projection. The system also included a head tracking system and passive 
      stereoscopy. The virtual audience consisted of one woman, and two men. Ten 
      healthy men, mean age 28.3 years (24-38 years), were confronted with the test 
      twice (1 week between sessions), during which salivary cortisol, heart rate (HR), 
      high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV, parasympathetic activity), and 
      T-wave amplitude (TWA, suggested to be related to sympathetic influence on 
      myocardial performance) were assessed. Cortisol secretion showed a marked 
      increase (88% vs. baseline) during the first stress provocation, but habituated 
      in the second session. The magnitude of HR and TWA reactivity during stress 
      provocation was approximately the same at both sessions, implying a stable 
      increase in sympathetic activity. Heart rate showed a maximum increase of 40% at 
      the first session, and 32% at the second. TWA showed a maximum decrease of 42% at 
      the first session, and 39% at the second. The results resemble those obtained in 
      prior studies using the real-life TSST. If these results can be replicated with 
      larger samples, VR technology may be used as a simple and standardized tool for 
      social stress induction in experimental settings.

AB  - The ultrasound machine was originally devised as a diagnostic tool to help 
      evaluate heart structure and function. With recent advances in ultrasound, 
      including live 3D ultrasound, its potential to guide interventions within the 
      heart has increasingly been recognized. Cardiologists have adapted this 
      technology and have now published guidelines on the use of ultrasound to guide 
      interventional procedures. Anesthesiologists have also used ultrasound with much 
      success in cardiac operating rooms (ORs) to guide cannula placement and, to a 
      limited extent, interventions. The focus of this article is a review of the 
      author's work on ultrasound and virtual reality-guided cardiac interventions, 
      both in the research laboratory and in the OR.

AB  - This Directed Reading article describes the physical principles and 
      instrumentation of computed tomography (CT) and outlines several recent advances 
      in CT technology. First, the history of CT is presented with emphasis on the 
      contributions of two pioneers who earned the Nobel Prize for the development of 
      the first clinically useful CT scanner. Second, the essential physical 
      principles-most notably radiation attenuation, Lambert-Beer's Law-and the 
      calculation of CT numbers using attenuation data are described. The third major 
      topic will focus on CT technology, including a description of the major system 
      components, the evolution of CT data acquisition systems, image reconstruction 
      fundamentals and common digital image postprocessing operations such as windowing 
      and three-dimensional (3D) techniques. The next section of this article addresses 
      the elements of spiral/helical CT principles and technology. The limitations of 
      conventional CT are first presented and provide a motivation for the development 
      of volume CT scanners. Data acquisition, including detector technology and 
      slip-ring technology, is reviewed, followed by a description of image 
      reconstruction basics for multislice CT (MSCT) scanning. In particular, MSCT 
      detector technology, pitch and various advantages are outlined, followed by a 
      discussion of the advantages of MSCT scanning. The final section of this reading 
      reviews the elements of MSCT applications, such as 3D imaging, virtual reality 
      imaging and the basics of cardiac CT imaging. The article concludes with an 
      introduction of the use of CT in other areas, such as radiation therapy and 
      nuclear medicine.

TI  - Real case virtual reality training prior to carotid artery stenting.
PG  - 279-82
LID - 10.1002/ccd.22211 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of procedural training especially in interventional 
      cardiology, still occurs on patients with direct mentoring by experienced 
      physicians during an actual clinical procedure. In recent years there is an 
      increase use of simulators especially for carotid artery stenting. However, most 
      simulators use "generic" predefined cases. METHODS AND RESULT: We report here a 
      simulation done on data of a real patient prior to intervention. The patient's 
      specific carotid anatomy was modeled using CTA on an endovascular simulator. 
      Pre-procedure patient-specific case rehearsal accurately predicted procedure 
      experience. CONCLUSIONS: A case rehearsal prior to an intervention may be useful 
      in the planning and execution of carotid artery stenting. The use of patient 
      specific simulation helps with planning of procedure and device selection, and 
      may lead to use of less contrast and radiation, and shorter procedure duration. 
      These may benefit the patient with increased success and lower complication 
      rates.

AB  - Wireless physiological/neurological monitoring in virtual reality (VR) offers a 
      unique opportunity for unobtrusively quantifying human responses to precisely 
      controlled and readily modulated VR representations of health care environments. 
      Here we present such a wireless, light-weight head-mounted system for measuring 
      electrooculogram (EOG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in human subjects 
      interacting with and navigating in the Calit2 StarCAVE, a five-sided immersive 
      3-D visualization VR environment. The system can be easily expanded to include 
      other measurements, such as cardiac activity and galvanic skin responses. We 
      demonstrate the capacity of the system to track focus of gaze in 3-D and report a 
      novel calibration procedure for estimating eye movements from responses to the 
      presentation of a set of dynamic visual cues in the StarCAVE. We discuss cyber 
      and clinical applications that include a 3-D cursor for visual navigation in VR 
      interactive environments, and the monitoring of neurological and ocular 
      dysfunction in vision/attention disorders.
